# GPUI Box source provenance

GPUI Box is an independent derivative project, not an official Zed project.
Provenance applies to imported and translated source as well as linked assets.
The machine-readable release record is `provenance.toml`.

Frozen paint recordings, per-allocation atlas leases, capture revision/reset
fences, and callback-free replay are original GPUI Box framework work. They
extend this tree's Scene, clipping, and native atlas implementations without
new source imports, dependency authority changes, or historical receipt edits.
The dynamic offscreen demonstrator uses existing bundled fonts and a synthetic
two-color image. Native Metal and Direct3D acceptance remains pending.

Calendar tick generation and source-traceable chart transforms are original
GPUI Box work. Calendar resolution uses the existing Chrono public TimeZone API;
the caller supplies production timezone policy. chrono-tz is a test-only
dependency for independent DST/date-line fixtures. No calendar source or timezone
database is copied into Kit, and DateAdapter ownership is unchanged.

Pointer-capture retirement and cached-hitbox identity retention are original local
GPUI Box framework changes. A vanished capture is cancelled before the previous
frame's listeners retire; no imported platform source or historical receipt is
changed. Portable framework tests cover cached redraw, unmount and reinsertion.

Assigned border-box root layout and configurable FLIP position/size timing are
original GPUI Box framework and Kit work. They reuse the local Taffy authority;
no source was imported or translated, no dependency authority changed, and the
historical import receipt remains frozen. The root assignment is invocation-local:
authored constraints return for natural measurement, while descendants, clipping,
pointer input and accessibility use the actual displayed layout.

The local geographic visualization family and synthetic exhibit are original
GPUI Box work. Projection formulas were checked against
[PROJ's Web Mercator definition](https://proj.org/en/stable/operations/projections/webmerc.html),
and the explicit ring/antimeridian subset against
[RFC 7946](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946). No source or geographic
dataset was copied or translated. Existing GPUI/Lyon path filling is reused;
there are no provider assets, new dependencies, or historical receipt changes.
`crates/docs/geography.md` records the deliberately bounded projected-edge contract.

Portable multi-contact arbitration, captured pan/pinch ownership, residual
scroll-to-manipulation handoff, interrupted-input cleanup, and the mobile
keyboard/inset/native text query contracts are original GPUI Box framework
work. They extend the historical single-touch import without changing its
receipt or introducing a new source dependency. Behavioral reference:
Android [multi-touch identity and cancellation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/gestures/multi),
UIKit [gesture lifecycle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizer),
[UITextInputTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextinputtraits),
and Android [EditorInfo](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/inputmethod/EditorInfo).
These references informed contracts; no platform documentation code was copied.
Shared tests establish only framework behavior, not native device integration.

Automatic pointer styling and typing/action cursor hiding now check independent
native operation capabilities. These are original GPUI Box corrections following
an executed UIKit first-frame failure, not imported platform code. Desktop-only
mobile host-check trait implementations explicitly reject non-native operations;
they do not fabricate handles or claim desktop backend support.
The 80 ms coarse-wheel transition shared by overflowing elements and
variable-height lists is original GPUI Box input/layout work as well. These
changes import no additional source and do not alter either frozen receipt.
Kit transition coordinate rebasing is recorded separately in P21.
The existing platform-independent priority queue is exported consistently across
hosts. Non-Android builds explicitly reject NDK surface calls rather than linking
Android symbols. These corrections add no source import or scheduling algorithm.

The Android JNI/Activity and UIKit hosts, mobile browser delivery, checked
native operation wrappers, WGPU surface lifecycle corrections, and mobile Kit
components are original GPUI Box work. They use public platform APIs rather
than imported backend implementations. Browser specification references are
recorded in `crates/gpui_web/MOBILE.md`; native contracts and remaining acceptance
work are recorded in `crates/gpui_android/README.md` and
`examples/ios-native/README.md`. Existing bundled fonts retain their existing
notices. SDKs, signing identities and development devices are external build
prerequisites, not vendored source. Neither native mobile backend is claimed
validated by the portable tests. Historical import receipts remain unchanged.

The shared mobile reference fixture and its Android/iOS launch and checkpoint
hosts are original GPUI Box example code. The fixture owns routing and data;
platform examples own private storage. They reuse bundled Kit assets with the
notices below and add no imported source. Offscreen fixture captures do not
certify native keyboard, accessibility, persistence or rendering.

Text-targeted edge fading, including the separation between text decorations
and non-text surfaces, paths, images, icons, shadows, sprites, and glass, is
original GPUI Box framework and Kit work. It extends the existing local edge
fade scope without importing renderer code, changing a native shader ABI, or
altering the frozen historical receipt. The baseline-relative glyph/emoji fade
correction in `crates/gpui/src/window.rs` is an original GPUI Box bugfix: opacity
uses the snapped raster sprite bounds, inverse-mapped through the visual
transform and converted from device to logical window coordinates. It imports
no source, shader, font, or dependency and leaves both frozen receipts untouched.

The source-line projection index, projected editable geometry, and disjoint
painted accessibility regions are original GPUI Box framework work. Editor
fold identities and transient toggle policy are original Kit work; no new
source import or historical receipt change is involved. Browser frame-clock
ticks now submit only dirty scenes or explicit presentation requests, and the
unused platform-surface uniform is padded to WebGPU's portable 16-byte binding
size so it cannot invalidate the complete pipeline set and force a WebGL2
fallback. These are original GPUI Box web-platform corrections and import no
source.

The September 2026 Windows hosting corrections (per-child regions, complete
empty-frame submission, and retry-safe saved-region ownership) are original
GPUI Box work. They do not change either frozen import receipt.
The shared mouse cancellation event, button-bound pointer capture, text/click
cleanup, browser chord reconciliation, and Windows chord capture lifetime are
likewise local framework corrections with no imported source.
Opt-in inline deferred accessibility ancestry, source-order child reservations, and
active-accessibility cache rebuilding are original GPUI Box corrections. The
80 ms coarse-wheel transition shared by overflowing elements and variable-height
lists is original GPUI Box input/layout work as well. These changes import no
additional source and do not alter either frozen receipt. Kit transition
coordinate rebasing is recorded separately in P21.

## P01: GPUI / Zed filtered framework import

- Official upstream: <https://github.com/zed-industries/zed>
- Bootstrap source: <https://github.com/fran0220/zed>
- Bootstrap revision: `0b9c8dc932b65cba2dc87464148984e93f60ae18`
- Official baseline: `a6a23c7b80a5cefa0487b7856335be89ace7e483`
- Filter definition: `scripts/sync-zed/config.json`
- Frozen import receipt: `scripts/sync-zed/state.json`
- Historical import algorithm: `first-parent-v1`
- License: Apache-2.0
- Copyright: Copyright 2022–2024 Zed Industries, Inc.

Framework/support subtrees listed in the filter were imported into GPUI Box and
renamed into the `gpui-box-*` package cohort. They are repository source, not a
Git-linked Cargo dependency. The bootstrap includes native surfaces, offscreen
WGPU, browser WebGPU/WebGL2 rendering and input, AccessKit projection, bounded
backdrop blur, pointer exit/capture, and first-prepaint tracked scrolling.
`wgpu` and `gpu-allocator` resolve from crates.io, not integration forks.
The workspace retains the pinned bootstrap's complete `windows` feature
authority. Its crates.io `zed-scap` substitute constrains `windows-capture` to
the compatible 1.4.4 API instead of restoring Zed's Cargo Git patch.

The committed receipt records bootstrap/vendor tip
`c036e5bcb472b7c557c231a66d69e646285d1942`, official cursor
`a6a23c7b80a5cefa0487b7856335be89ace7e483`, and integration merge
`82fdda6a265e556afc65b9ff1eb200f7bda8d3fc`. The offline verifier checks the
frozen vendor ref, commit source trailer, filtered destinations, exact merge,
and its ancestry through the current first-parent history. The receipt is not a
future source movement mechanism. License text: `licenses/ZED-APACHE-2.0.txt`.

Post-bootstrap native PlatformView support is tracked as an independent fork
overlay, not as official-Zed replay. Its exact linear source chain is
`1755444d8efd9c7b34d8f2fbe36a327b85ca4e9b`,
`f212b120ede8c5ffcc5c60ebe1ac92d64fab9db7`,
`7bcda540a22cf9e8bbd946f954c8f28f266e452b`, and
`b46bf740a55c53612b14120f5dfbb7ceec463261`, each fetched from the same fork
and rooted directly at the bootstrap revision. The last commit supplies the
complete Windows redirection-backed popup-host implementation; the fork's later
main merge and its sibling layered-child implementation are deliberately not
part of this source lane. `provenance.toml [historical_overlay]` records the
shared filter digest, deterministic overlay tip, and exact integration merge.
Offline release verification checks every retained overlay commit, source
trailer, parent, vendor ref, and integration marker and proves that both lanes
meet only at the filtered bootstrap.

The two-repository development model ended after this import. GPUI Box is now
the sole development authority for GPUI, its platform implementations, media,
and Kit. The Zed repositories and recorded SHAs remain source attribution and
license evidence only; they are not synchronization remotes or compatibility
targets for future framework work.

The `PlatformViewHandle::keep_alive` lifetime attachment is subsequent GPUI
Box work, not part of either imported lane. It changes no native hosting or
renderer behavior; it retains caller-owned native controller state until the
existing host has detached and released its final handle clone.

Window-control hit testing that gives a later-painted nested caption control or
explicit client area precedence over its enclosing drag area, vetoable
programmatic close requests, current-request-position native caption hit tests,
corrected Windows horizontal/vertical resize-frame metrics for transparent
title bars, host-reserved Toast edges, grayscale glyph rasterization on
transparent native scene-overlay planes, and Direct3D offscreen-pass target
restoration are also subsequent GPUI Box work. Deferring a native frame request
that synchronously re-enters while the application is already borrowed, while
preserving its forced-render and presentation intents, belongs to this same
framework-owned window lane. Discarding accessibility action registrations
while the per-frame AccessKit state is inactive is a GPUI Box correction in
that window lane as well. They use the existing operating-system and GPUI
layout APIs and import no additional source.

The renderer-backed linear, elliptical radial, and conic gradient primitives
with up to eight ordered color stops are also subsequent GPUI Box work. Their
shared inline scene representation and Metal, Direct3D, WGPU, and WebGL shader
implementations were authored here; they import no additional framework or
shader source.

The derivative-free polychrome sprite corner mask is subsequent GPUI Box work.
The analytic gradient of the existing quad signed distance field, and the
device-pixel ramp width derived from it through the sprite's own transform,
were authored here in the Metal, Direct3D, and WGPU/WebGL shaders that already
carried the field. The correction imports no source, shader, or visual asset.

The primitive-aware scroll-edge fade correction is subsequent GPUI Box work.
Solid filled paths reuse the existing renderer-backed gradient in the clipped
bounds every path shader already reads; large shadows, SVG masks, images, and
sprite instances sample uniform alpha at the center of their visible
fade-region intersection. Small atomic primitives retain nearest-edge
sampling. This correction imports no source, shader, or visual asset.

The composited sprite-batch scene primitive, explicit atlas source rectangles,
center-relative transforms, rounded/source-alpha masks, tint modes, and normal,
additive, and screen pipeline states are subsequent GPUI Box work across Metal,
Direct3D, WGPU, and WebGL. The procedural RGBA8 image constructor and canonical
sprite atlas are authored here and import no source, shader, or visual asset.

The deterministic CPU particle sampler, bounded emitter contract, absolute-time
birth and trajectory math, built-in alpha-mask atlas, and policy-owned Kit
recipes are subsequent GPUI Box work. They reuse that sprite-batch renderer and
import no simulation source, shader, or visual asset.

Normalized path-stroke trimming and wrapping dash offsets are subsequent GPUI
Box work at the pre-tessellation path boundary. They use the existing Lyon
measurement and tessellation dependency and import no source or visual assets.

The read-only selectable-text primitive, wrapped and bidirectional range
geometry, pointer-capture interaction, clipboard behavior, and AccessKit text
run publication are subsequent GPUI Box work. Rounded backgrounds for shaped
text fragments were added at the same framework boundary so selection does not
force Kit highlights to recompose text into separate layout elements. They use
the workspace's existing Unicode segmentation and bidirectional libraries and
import no editor or product source.

The product-neutral editable-text buffer, grapheme-safe selection and
replacement transactions, marked-composition lifecycle, grouped undo/redo,
length policy, and UTF-8/UTF-16 conversion are also subsequent GPUI Box work.
The wrapped and bidirectional editable layout, byte/point and visual-row
mapping, alignment-aware hit testing, selection/caret geometry, reveal-scroll
projection, and generic normalized style runs are part of the same subsequent
work. Current-frame editable AccessKit positions, widths, and run bounds are
captured from that same shaped layout rather than a second accessibility
layout. They move the shared authority used by Kit's plain text controls to the
framework boundary and use the existing shaping and Unicode segmentation
dependencies; no editor, document-format, grammar, language-server, or product
source is imported.

The per-window labelled-by, described-by, and cross-tree active-descendant
resolver, including inverse label/description declarations, deferred-subtree
resolution, focused-owner validation, ambiguous-target refusal, stale-endpoint
removal, and absent-scalar text fallback is subsequent GPUI Box work. It fills
the existing AccessKit relationship and focus projection from role-bearing GPUI
element identities while supplying native adapters the same resolved name/help
text when they do not consume those properties. It imports no accessibility
adapter, product, or UI source.

The resolved-focus prepaint observer is subsequent GPUI Box work at that same
element boundary. It exposes the exact explicit or framework-generated handle
already used for dispatch and AccessKit, allowing diagnostics to publish focus
without allocating a second handle or maintaining a parallel identity map. It
imports no accessibility adapter, product, or UI source.

The window-owned document-selection coordinator, caller-declared reading order,
overlay scope isolation, truthful virtualized-copy coverage, and aggregate
clipboard path are subsequent GPUI Box work above that selectable-text
primitive. The generic `ScrollTarget` contract over overflowing containers,
uniform lists, and measured variable-height lists is GPUI Box work as well.
Both additions coordinate existing framework layout and input state and import
no editor, product, or third-party source.

The inline sticky-subtree transform, deferred-prepaint content-mask retention,
and inset-aware focus reveal contract are subsequent GPUI Box work at the
shared layout/input boundary. They keep layout, clipping, hit testing,
accessibility geometry, and paint on one translated subtree and import no
browser sticky implementation, grid source, product policy, or third-party
code.

The stable-id measured `Reveal` subtree and content-mask-aware AccessKit bounds
are subsequent GPUI Box work at that same framework boundary. The primitive
keeps natural measurement, in-flow extent, clipping, hit testing, and
role-bearing accessibility geometry together while leaving clocks, easing, and
component policy to callers. It imports no disclosure component, animation
system, browser implementation, product policy, or third-party code.

The bounded native external-data drag bridge for encoded images, MIME-tagged
text, URLs, and promised or virtual files on macOS and Windows is subsequent
GPUI Box work. It uses operating-system drag and pasteboard APIs and imports no
third-party or product source.

Per-window structural frame counters, retained element-arena growth
accounting, deterministic Kit performance budgets, and the 10,000-item
component fixtures are subsequent GPUI Box work. They instrument existing
framework draw boundaries and import no profiler, allocator, benchmark, or
product source.

Reference-counted frame-trace leases and the bounded per-window timing monitor
are subsequent GPUI Box work over those same draw boundaries. They derive
summaries from observed draw timestamps without scheduling frames and import no
profiler HUD, product, or third-party source.

The explicit `Styled::font_fallbacks` refinement, grapheme-aware fallback run
selection, and DirectWrite lookup across registered and system collections are
subsequent GPUI Box work. They make caller-declared font chains a consistent
framework contract across native and offscreen renderers and import no source.
Role-aware face acceptance — a face reached only as a fallback is no longer
required to carry the `m` that em measurement uses, and is no longer removed
from the shared database for lacking it — and CoreText process-scope
registration of embedded fonts on macOS are the same lane of work. Both make an
embedded symbol-only face reachable by the name a cascade list gives it.

The full-frame platform-view clipping and macOS restacking implementation is
also subsequent GPUI Box work. It extends the product-neutral host contract on
both native platforms and imports no platform-view source from Zed or another
project.

The `gpui-box-media` AVFoundation and Media Foundation playback services are
also subsequent GPUI Box work. They call operating-system frameworks supplied
by macOS and Windows and import no third-party player source or media assets.

## P09: optional dotLottie raster backend

- Backend: `rasterlottie` 0.2.2
- Source: <https://github.com/neodyland/rasterlottie>
- License: MIT OR Apache-2.0
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 neodyland contributors
- Archive reader: `zip` 8.6.0, <https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2>, MIT,
  Copyright (c) 2014 Mathijs van de Nes
- Relationship: optional crates.io dependencies; no Cargo Git source

GPUI Box's public dotLottie contracts, semantic recipes, poster behavior, and
particle fallbacks are authored here and expose no backend type. The optional
`gpui-box-kit/dotlottie` feature uses `rasterlottie` only after Box validates
and fully reads a host-provided archive under hard and host-tightenable limits,
inspects embedded image dimensions and aggregate target pixels, then rebuilds a
bounded stored archive for decoding. The official `dotlottie-rs` crate is not
linked: its crates.io alpha depends on native Conan/bindgen/ThorVG artifacts
while current releases are Git-only, which conflicts with the repository's
crates.io/local package authority. No animation, visual asset, URL, path, or
product model is imported.

## P08: `block` 0.1.6 compatibility fork

- Source: <https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-block>
- Revision/tag: `47178790cfc9d4a8b092051d8b413b78bd31254a`
  (`0.1.6`)
- Historical parent license source:
  <https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>
- License: MIT; copyright (c) Steven Sheldon
- Local source: `vendor/block`

The macOS Cocoa, Core Video, and Metal crates still resolve `block` 0.1.6,
whose final upstream release declares `_NSConcreteStackBlock` with an empty,
uninhabited enum. Rust warns that such an extern static will become a hard
error. The vendored source changes only that private opaque marker to an
inhabited zero-sized `#[repr(C)]` struct and spells the previously implicit C
ABI explicitly on function pointers. Consumers still pass the address of the
same external symbol through the same pointer-sized `isa` field, so no symbol,
calling convention, block layout, or public API changes. Both Cargo workspaces
pin this exact local source, and the dependency gate rejects any additional
patch. Its audited `src/lib.rs` SHA-256 is
`51e54353cee1cc853e567d140d35b4a74e27d5cbdbcbe68e979269f39209906a`.

Kit text-input code under `crates/gpui-kit/src/controls/input/` follows GPUI's
`EntityInputHandler`, UTF-8/UTF-16 conversion, shaping, caret, and selection
architecture. The kit editing model, bindings, masking, limits, semantics, and
theme policy are GPUI Box work under MIT.

## P02: Comet presentation system

- Revision: `fb22e269ac57331ee7aa4a9673530acf3299a886`
- License: MIT; copyright (c) 2026 Wing
- Scope: source-derived theme geometry, motion, loader math, popover/dialog and
  settings scaffolding, frost, edge fade, font registration, and generic assets
- Excluded: product engine, RPC, transport, accounts, provider brands, runtime
  state, and product authority

License text: `licenses/COMET-MIT.txt`.

## P03: Geist and Geist Mono

- Source: <https://vercel.com/font>; transported through P02
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1

- Files: `crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/fonts/Geist*.ttf`
- License text: `licenses/GEIST-OFL-1.1.txt`

## P04: Phosphor Icons Core 2.1.1

- Source: <https://github.com/phosphor-icons/core>
- Revision: `2b75f3ad12b420c9504ef05df8d2564a28f8500e`
- Package version: 2.1.1
- License: MIT; Copyright (c) 2023 Phosphor Icons
- Scope: the controlled Regular and Fill subset under
  `crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/icons/`
- Selection and reading-direction decisions:
  `crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/PHOSPHOR.toml`
- Exact byte receipts: `crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/icons/SHA256SUMS`
- License text: `crates/gpui-kit-assets/licenses/PHOSPHOR-MIT.txt`

`cargo run -p xtask -- icons import <phosphor-core-checkout>` accepts only that
package version and exact Git revision, copies only the manifest selection,
and regenerates the Rust path catalog and SHA-256 receipts. `icons check`, also
part of the gate, rejects stale generated source, added or missing SVGs,
non-256-unit/non-`currentColor` SVGs, external references, scripts, and byte
drift.

## P05: Noto Sans Symbols and script fallback families

- Source: <https://github.com/notofonts/notofonts.github.io>
- Revision: `c16b117609abbe4e60b3f2bd4433bdb3d0accb2e`
- Versions: Noto Sans Symbols 2.003; Noto Sans Symbols 2 2.008
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1, no Reserved Font Name
- Copyright: Copyright 2022 The Noto Project Authors
- File: `crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/fonts/KeySymbols.ttf`

This is a seven-glyph subset (`⌘ ⌃ ⌥ ⏎ ⌦ ⌫ ␣`), renamed `GPUI Kit Key
Symbols` to avoid shadowing an installed Noto family. The exact recipe is in
`crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/SOURCE.md`; license text is
`licenses/NOTO-OFL-1.1.txt`.

The complete Noto Sans Arabic 2.012 and Noto Sans Hebrew 3.001 variable faces
come from <https://github.com/google/fonts> revision
`352f6b7d9d6cc4fa9e242b931291d31b21a6dc84`, paths
`ofl/notosansarabic/NotoSansArabic[wdth,wght].ttf` and
`ofl/notosanshebrew/NotoSansHebrew[wdth,wght].ttf`. They are unmodified,
licensed under OFL 1.1 with no Reserved Font Name, and live at
`crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/fonts/NotoSansArabic.ttf` and
`NotoSansHebrew.ttf`. Exact SHA-256 checksums are recorded in the asset crate's
`assets/SOURCE.md`.

The Simplified Chinese language subset of Noto Sans CJK comes from
<https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk> revision `f8d157532fbfaeda587e826d4cd5b21a49186f7c`, path
`Sans/SubsetOTF/SC/NotoSansSC-Regular.otf`. It is unmodified, licensed under
OFL 1.1 with no Reserved Font Name, and lives at
`crates/gpui-kit-assets/assets/fonts/NotoSansSC.otf`. Its SHA-256 checksum is
recorded in the asset crate's `assets/SOURCE.md`.

It is bundled for the same reason the Arabic and Hebrew faces are: so that the
script renders the same in the headless harness, on each native platform, and
in the browser, rather than depending on what the machine happens to have
installed. Adding it changes no Latin output — the fallback is consulted only
for glyphs Geist does not carry, and a rendered scene is byte-identical with
and without it.

## P06: Framework test and fallback fonts

- IBM Plex Sans source: <https://github.com/IBM/plex>
- Lilex source: <https://github.com/mishamyrt/Lilex>
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1
- Files: `crates/gpui/assets/fonts/`, `crates/gpui_web/assets/fonts/`, and
  `crates/gpui_wgpu/assets/fonts/`

These fonts arrived with the filtered GPUI framework source. Each public crate
that embeds them carries `assets/fonts/SOURCES.md` and the applicable license
text beside the font files, so its `.crate` archive is independently
redistributable.

## P10: bezel terminal and markdown document model

- Source: <https://github.com/crabtalk/bezel>
- Revision: `86b8997c0601ebcd416632ebde33d78f82b05917`
- License: MIT
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 clearloop
- Source locations: `crates/terminal/src/{emulator.rs,view.rs}` and
  `crates/markdown/src/{doc.rs,parse.rs,serialize.rs,edit.rs}`, with the
  matching `tests/`
- Destinations: `crates/gpui-kit/src/content/terminal/` and
  `crates/gpui-kit/src/content/markdown/doc/`

A source-level port, not a dependency: bezel pins `gpui` to a Zed Git
revision, and this repository is the sole authority for its own GPUI
packages. License text is `licenses/BEZEL-MIT.txt`.

The port is not a transplant. The terminal's per-appearance ANSI tables became
`color.terminal.*` in the token documents, because a palette compiled into a
component is the second colour authority the token rule exists to prevent, and
the contrast report now covers all sixteen slots against the terminal
background. The emulator's public API was rewritten so no `alacritty_terminal`
type appears in it. The markdown document model arrived with its round-trip
fixed-point tests, which are the property the model is worth having for.

### `alacritty_terminal`

- Source: <https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty>
- Version: 0.26.0 (crates.io)
- License: Apache-2.0
- Scope: the escape-sequence state machine and grid behind
  `content::terminal::Emulator`

Behind the `terminal` feature, which is on by default so the gate, the gallery
and the visual baselines all cover the component. Only `Term`, the ANSI
`Processor`, `Selection` and the grid types are used. The crate's `tty` and
`event_loop` modules compile and are never referenced: they have no feature to
turn off upstream, and this repository opens no pty and spawns no process,
which stays the host's job. Recorded here rather than left implicit, because a
UI crate that links a process spawner should have to say so.

## P12: clear liquid-glass material and dual-source renderer

- Material-policy source: <https://github.com/crabtalk/bezel>
- Bezel revision: `2cfff23c96c6d33177a65d523f1827b0941b2eac`
- Bezel license: MIT
- Renderer source: <https://github.com/crabtalk/zed>
- Renderer revision: `ddd1c7d2cd98e1109f5bc4e21488c7ec8aefe198`
- Renderer parent: `756cafe25ddfa4a702c39db70f4b16d6276c02a3`
- Renderer license: Apache-2.0
- Source locations: Bezel `crates/ui/src/material.rs`; crabtalk/zed
  `crates/gpui/src/{scene.rs,window.rs}` and
  `crates/gpui_apple/src/{metal_renderer.rs,shaders.metal}`
- Destinations: GPUI Box `crates/gpui/src/{scene.rs,window.rs}`,
  `crates/gpui_{macos,wgpu,windows}/src/`, and
  `crates/gpui-kit/src/overlay/glass.rs`

This is a source-level, product-neutral adaptation, not a Cargo dependency and
not a reopening of the frozen Zed import lane. Bezel supplies the measured
material policy: clear glass defaults to no blur, bevel depth is 0.225 of the
short edge, magnification is 0.34, dispersion is 0.005, white additive lift is
0.075, transmission gain is 1.042, and the hairline is one logical pixel. The
crabtalk/zed commit supplies the dual-source rendering model and spherical
profile: preserve sharp and blurred snapshots, blend the sharp source toward
the rim by `(1 - depth)²`, and cap displacement at 0.45 of the bevel.

GPUI Box generalized the Metal-only source across its existing multi-lobe SDF,
paint-order, clipping, probe, WGPU, and Direct3D infrastructure. It retained
the existing directional specular interaction as an independent optional axis,
made blur part of the framework material rather than a call-site gate, and
added bounded-pass fallback and cross-renderer tests. The separate 16-surface
per-frame admission budget, replay-aware ordinary-fill fallback, and rejection
of over-budget probe work are subsequent GPUI Box framework work rather than
adapted source. Limiting snapshot, blur, and composite work to conservative
device-pixel regions, precomputing WGPU Gaussian weights into a GPU texture,
reusing WGPU bind groups, and publishing Metal luminance readings from command
buffer completion handlers are later GPUI Box renderer work over the same
material contract. They import no additional source. Bezel's license text is

No upstream file is vendored: each preset is a token document written here,
carrying the same key set as `studio-dark.json`, whose colour values are the
published hexadecimal palettes above. Nothing outside the palette — spacing,
motion, elevation, control metrics — comes from upstream.

Where a published value could not clear this repository's contrast, surface
separation, tone distinction, line visibility or placeholder loudness gates, it
was moved along its own lightness ramp by the smallest step that passes and the
hue was kept. Those are the presets' own values and are not attributed to
upstream:

- `nord`: `nord11` `#bf616a` lightened to `#cf7c85` for `danger` and the diff's
  removed sign, and the Aurora tints lightened for the five agent families,
  which carry the body text floor rather than the identity floor. The ANSI
  table keeps `#bf616a` unchanged.
- `solarized-dark` and `solarized-light`: the `base01`/`base00`/`base0`/`base1`
  ladder is the scheme's defining low-contrast feature and cannot seat five
  distinguishable text tones over six surfaces, so both presets carry their own
  five-rung grey ladder in Solarized's hue with the upstream steps kept in
  `palette.neutral.300` and `.500` and across the ANSI table. `red`, `yellow`,
  `green`, `cyan` and `blue` are moved a step where a surface required it.
- `catppuccin-latte`: `yellow`, `green`, `teal` and `magenta` darkened for the
  page they sit on, and `mauve` darkened where it paints code.
- `gruvbox-dark`: bright `purple` `#d3869b` lightened to `#d992a5` for the
  agent family tint only.

Two non-colour tokens are also theme-owned rather than upstream:
`effect.focusRingAlpha` is 1 in `catppuccin-latte`, `solarized-light` and
`solarized-dark`, and `opacity.disabled` is raised in the two light presets,
because both schemes' text sits closer to their page than the studio pair's
does.

## P07: Hash Function Prospector `lowbias32`

- Source: <https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector>
- Revision: `396dbe235c94dfc2e9b559fc965bcfda8b6a122c`
- Author/discoverer: Christopher Wellons (`skeeto`)
- Source location: `README.md`, `lowbias32`
- License: public-domain dedication under the Unlicense
- Scope: the `lowbias32` finalizer translated to Metal, HLSL, and WGSL for
  deterministic gradient dithering

GPUI Box adds the two-dimensional screen-pixel fold, domain-separation salts,
and triangular sample mapping. The exact upstream license is preserved in
`licenses/HASH-PROSPECTOR-UNLICENSE.txt` and beside each public renderer crate
that contains the translation.

No product state, credentials, telemetry, user content, provider logos, or Zed
editor/workspace/product source is included by the framework filter.

## P13: GPUI Component plot behavior reference

- Reference: <https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component>
- Revision: `6761b4ec9ca90cf2c37f8ba01deaa9ffcf0d0da7`
- License: Apache-2.0
- Reference locations: `crates/ui/src/plot/mod.rs`,
  `crates/ui/src/chart/candlestick_chart.rs`, and
  `crates/ui/src/chart/sankey_chart.rs`
- Destination: `crates/gpui-kit/src/display/plot.rs`

The reference established the product-neutral separation between a measured
plot frame, caller data, and styled chart wrappers. GPUI Box's implementation
is original and deliberately narrower: callers supply normalized mark, OHLC,
node, and ribbon geometry; Kit supplies stable semantic ids, measured bounds,
keyboard traversal, truthful states, and theme presentation. No upstream Rust
source was copied. In particular, GPUI Box does not include or translate the
referenced `d3-sankey` topology/layout algorithm, and carries no d3 dependency
or financial fixture policy.

## P14: GPUI Component FPS behavior reference

- Reference: <https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component>
- Revision: `6761b4ec9ca90cf2c37f8ba01deaa9ffcf0d0da7`
- License: Apache-2.0
- Reference locations: `crates/fps/src/lib.rs`,
  `crates/fps/src/monitor.rs`, `crates/fps/src/overlay.rs`,
  `crates/fps/src/sampler.rs`, and `crates/fps/src/style.rs`
- Destination: `crates/gpui/src/profiler.rs` and
  `crates/gpui-kit/src/display/performance_hud.rs`

The reference established the usefulness of a bounded, per-window live frame
reading. GPUI Box's implementation is original and separates responsibilities
more strictly: the framework monitor derives FPS from recorded draw-start
timestamps and never requests a frame, while the controlled Kit view owns no
monitor, clock, history, resource sampler, overlay placement, or refresh loop.
Draw-budget overage is not called a dropped frame, and all styling, strings,
numbers, states, and semantic ids use existing Box authorities. No upstream
Rust source, resource-profiling code, or dependency was copied.

## P15: GPUI Component editor behavior reference

- Reference: <https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component>
- Revision: `6761b4ec9ca90cf2c37f8ba01deaa9ffcf0d0da7`
- License: Apache-2.0
- Reference location: `crates/ui/src/input/editor.rs`
- Destination: `crates/gpui-kit/src/controls/editor.rs` and
  `crates/gpui-kit/src/controls/textarea`

The reference established the usefulness of a source-oriented editing surface
with line numbers and syntax styling. GPUI Box's implementation is original
and deliberately uses its existing `TextArea` as the sole document, selection,
IME, history, geometry, paint, hit-test, and accessibility authority. `Editor`
adds only no-wrap source policy, hard-line projection, revision-tagged
caller-owned styles, and a synchronous indentation request. No upstream Rust
source, parser, grammar, language-server transport, product model, or
dependency was copied.

## P16: GPUI Component dock behavior reference

- Reference: <https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component>
- Revision: `6761b4ec9ca90cf2c37f8ba01deaa9ffcf0d0da7`
- License: Apache-2.0
- Reference locations: `crates/base/src/dock/layout`,
  `crates/base/src/dock/drag.rs`, `crates/base/src/dock/tab_group.rs`, and
  `crates/base/src/dock/state.rs`
- Destination: `crates/gpui-kit/src/layout/dock_tree.rs`

The reference established the product-neutral value of recursive split/tab
topology, persistent empty tab groups, and separate centre-merge and edge-split
drop intents. GPUI Box's implementation is original and projects caller-owned
records through its existing `SplitLayout`/`SplitTree`, `Tabs`, and drag system.
It includes no upstream Rust source, panel registry, application model, skin,
tile renderer, persistence transport, or dependency, and never invents the
stable ids required to apply an edge split.

## P17: GPUI Component native-menu behavior reference

- Reference: <https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component>
- Revision: `6761b4ec9ca90cf2c37f8ba01deaa9ffcf0d0da7`
- License: Apache-2.0
- Reference locations: `crates/ui/src/native_menu/mod.rs`,
  `crates/ui/src/native_menu/macos.rs`,
  `crates/ui/src/native_menu/windows.rs`, and
  `crates/ui/src/native_menu/fallback.rs`
- Destinations: `crates/gpui/src/platform/app_menu.rs`,
  `crates/gpui/src/window.rs`, `crates/gpui_macos/src/window.rs`,
  `crates/gpui_windows/src/window.rs`, and
  `crates/gpui-kit/src/overlay/menu.rs`

The reference established the product-neutral contract of mapping a recursive
GPUI action menu to `NSMenu`/`HMENU`, running native tracking outside an active
GPUI borrow, and retaining a drawn fallback. GPUI Box implements that contract
at its framework/platform boundary over its existing `Menu` and `MenuItem`
authority, returns an explicit unsupported result, captures the originating
focus context, reports native completion to Kit, and reuses Kit's existing
accessible `ContextMenu` as the fallback. It does not include the upstream
component-native menu model, root overlay, icon loading/rasterization, theme
hooks, or source files, and adds no dependency.

The Longbridge release exposed the capability delta but is not the source of
the framework code: `gpui-pre` is Zed's published GPUI crate, and the original
work is identified by the Zed commits above. The release was not installed as a
package because doing so would create a second GPUI type universe beside
`gpui-box`. Zed's Apache-2.0 spring solver, target projection, interpolation
types, playback builder, sampled easing, and element animation lifecycle were
therefore adapted into GPUI Box's existing framework authority.
Local changes retain reduced-motion behavior, use the repository's scheduler,
and add coverage for every damping regime, retargeted velocity, playback
states, and finite overshoot. Kit's existing token/perceptual `Spring`, visual
settling policy, transitions, presence, and FLIP remain its policy layer but
delegate scalar evolution to the framework solver.

Zed's portable touch recognizer, least-squares release velocity,
prediction reconciliation, tap/multi-tap synthesis, axis-locked pan, catchable
fling momentum, phased touch-drag/long-press claiming, cancellation, and window
dispatch were adapted at the same framework boundary. GPUI Box retains the
public `GestureTuning::momentum_decay_per_ms` field and adds
`PlatformGestures::scroll_physics` for selecting the package's exponential or
Android friction-spline model. The spline is the package's Apache-2.0
transcription of AOSP `OverScroller.SplineOverScroller`
(<https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/main/core/java/android/widget/OverScroller.java>;
Copyright 2006 The Android Open Source Project). The complete imported bytes are
fixed by the package checksum and source revision above.

At import time this was a portable single-touch input path: additional contacts
were ignored while one touch was active, pinch remained a platform event, and
the import added no native iOS/Android touch producer. Subsequent original
GPUI Box multi-contact work is described above. No
`gpui-pre`, Longbridge, Zed Git source, or Cargo patch was added.

Zed's split draw/submission profiler model also informed the local
framework boundary. GPUI Box keeps its existing feature-independent,
reference-counted frame trace leases, passive per-window monitor, bounded
history, benchmark draw records, deterministic `FrameStats`, and Kit HUD. It
adds a paired submission record at the synchronous `PlatformWindow` draw-call
boundary, carries first-input time and top-level coalesced input count to that
record, and guards draw-to-submit pairing across trace enable/disable
transitions. Local APIs deliberately say “submission”: return from that call is
not evidence of compositor or display presentation. The package's profiler
journal, hang reporting, and debug frame overlay were not imported.

The release's retained dock model was compared with GPUI Box's existing
caller-owned `DockTopology` and `DockTree`. Upstream `PaneTree` mutations,
normalization, panel entities and registry, and `DockArea` reconciliation cache
solve a different ownership contract and were not imported. Box instead pins
its controlled boundary with behavior tests for persistence fixpoints and empty
stacks, malformed-record refusal, unrelated-ratio stability, split-local resize
intents, one move intent per completed drop, and dimensionless ratios. No dock
source from this release was copied or translated by this audit.

## P19: system glass and scroll-edge design intent

- Design source: Apple WWDC25 session 310, "Build an AppKit app with the new
  design"
- Scope: design intent only — floating chrome on glass, content edge-to-edge,
  scroll-edge separation, adaptive appearance, and `NSGlassEffectView` as the
  current macOS window material
- Destinations: `crates/gpui/src/platform.rs` (`WindowBackgroundAppearance::SystemGlass`),
  `crates/gpui_macos/src/window.rs` (runtime `NSGlassEffectView` embed),
  `crates/gpui/src/scene.rs` (`GlassMaterial` edge mask),
  `crates/gpui-kit/src/overlay/glass.rs` (`tint`, `adaptive_appearance`),
  `crates/gpui-kit/src/layout/scroll_edge.rs`

No Apple source was copied. The macOS path looks up `NSGlassEffectView` at
runtime and does not link a macOS 26 SDK. The within-window optics remain the
P12 dual-source material; the system view only samples the desktop behind the
window. Windows maps `SystemGlass` to the current DWM Mica backdrop. The
scroll-edge ramp and counterpart-appearance flip are original GPUI Box work
that implement the documented design intent on every renderer.

## P20: achromatic glass material

Original GPUI Box implementation, informed by Apple HIG Materials and WWDC25
session 219 design intent, not copied Apple source. `GlassMaterial` and the
Metal, HLSL and WGSL composite paths add saturation and source-over achromatic
wash before additive optical lift. The historical import receipt is unchanged;
all framework and platform code remains under the local GPUI Box authority.

The analytic glass-field derivatives and scattered-source rim sampling are
original GPUI Box corrections. They reuse the local rounded-rect derivative,
differentiate the existing polynomial union, and remove sharp-source remixing;
no upstream source or historical import receipt is changed. CPU shape tests and
Metal pixel tests cover medial-axis normals, true arc highlights, and rim
text-stroke scattering without changing material strengths.
The shared `BackdropGlass::optical_bevel` additionally bounds the profile by
rounded-corner reach before GPU packing. This original geometry correction
removes the remaining arc-centre singularity on small-radius menus; it changes
neither shader ABI nor source provenance.

Framework luminance probe leases and the generation/submission-aware CPU cache
are original GPUI Box ownership infrastructure. Metal, Direct3D and WGPU retain
the existing fixed-size GPU readbacks and decode physical slots only for offsets;
full lease IDs reject stale owners and activations without a new shader interface.
`BackdropStatistics` and shared CPU decoding of the same five encoded texels
are original GPUI Box work, with no new GPU copies, ABI or imported source.

Rounded subtree geometry, pointer clipping, conservative accessibility bounds,
retained/deferred chain propagation and scene replay are original GPUI Box
framework work. Metal, Direct3D and WGPU clip transports mask primitive writes
without changing optical source captures. The shared rounded-rectangle field
is extracted from the existing local geometry. No new third-party dependency
or source is introduced; the frozen historical import receipt is unchanged.

Uniform subtree visual transforms, effective text/image raster scaling,
retained transform invalidation, displayed accessibility geometry and Kit
text-consumer pointer/IME coordinate mapping are original GPUI Box work under
the existing framework and Kit licenses. They introduce no imported source,
dependency or native shader ABI change; the frozen receipt remains unchanged.
Kit Glass descendant clipping uses the framework scope without reapplying
coverage to the surface's rounded fill, border or shadow.

Explicit inherited-mask escape (`Window::without_content_masks` and
`Deferred::unclipped`) is original GPUI Box framework work. It preserves
visual transforms and logical ownership while allowing Kit window overlays
to escape ancestor masks. No source, dependency or shader ABI is imported;
the frozen historical receipt is unchanged.

The foreground press policy, five-sample variance-driven shadow policy,
persistent resize reference producer and forward observable comparison/fitting
tools are original GPUI Box work. The 1.014 foreground-scale token is a Kit
design choice informed by the native 144×48 label specimen's approximate
1.0134 held fit; neither that specimen nor these policies establish universal
Apple behavior. The Python tools use NumPy and Pillow as development tooling
(pinned in their requirements file); no library source or native frames are
embedded in the runtime packages. Native low-amplitude evidence does not support
a full active-rim coordinate map, so observable errors retain all regions rather
than forcing a ray interpretation.

### Kit Regular/Clear material policy

The Kit overlay recipes now use Regular Liquid, reserving `Clear` with a
35% dimming backing for media. Apple HIG Materials and WWDC25 session 219
provide design intent only; no Apple source or imagery was copied. Small
controls may resolve their counterpart appearance from backdrop luminance;
large reading surfaces do not flip. These are original Kit policies layered
over the existing local GPUI primitives, not another framework import.

`Theme::with_reduce_transparency(bool)` carries a host-projected reader
preference, outside tokens. All glass presets and built-in overlay recipes
resolve to Frosted under that theme; Kit does not read platform preferences.

### Unicode line-breaking authority

GPUI's unshaped fragment wrapper and shaped glyph wrapper use
`unicode-linebreak` 0.1.5 (Unicode 15.0 UAX #14), already present in the local
lockfiles through cosmic-text. Wrapped truncation reuses the fragment wrapper.
The fragment/object byte mapping and layout integration are original GPUI Box
work, not a new upstream source import. The historical import receipt remains
unchanged; both workspaces continue to resolve local GPUI Box packages.

### Intrinsic image layout

`Window::request_intrinsic_layout` and the local Taffy layout view are original
GPUI Box integration over the existing Taffy 0.12.2 public tree/cache and
container algorithm APIs. Intrinsic content dimensions are distinct from
caller-authored aspect ratio. No dependency source is vendored or patched,
and the frozen import receipt and both workspaces' package authority remain
unchanged. Shader code and image atlas formats are unchanged.

### Stable virtual row geometry and nested scrolling

`ListState::remap_items`, shared `ListOffset::remap`, retained unmeasured height
estimates, and per-dispatch source-axis wheel remainders through
`Window::consume_scroll_delta` are original GPUI Box framework work. Callers map
their stable identities to previous indices; the framework preserves measured
geometry, focus handles and absolute within-row anchors. Kit supplies separate
row content revisions, keyed uniform anchors, window-local remeasurement and
consumes actual scroll direction for follow state. Wheel leftovers preserve
native line units and reach ancestors without repeating consumed movement.
No external source was imported, no renderer ABI or platform event translation
changed, and the frozen historical import receipt is unchanged. Root and
headless workspaces retain the same local package authority.

### Incremental editable document storage

`EditBuffer` stores text in Ropey 1.6.1 (MIT), with LF-only line indexing and
lazy contiguous compatibility snapshots. The byte-coordinate integration,
rope-chunk grapheme clamping, and exact history replay are original GPUI Box
work. Ropey is a crates.io dependency, not a source port or synchronization
lane. The frozen import receipt and local framework authority are unchanged.

No-wrap `EditableTextLayout` uses the local `WindowTextSystem` to shape visible
hard lines and exact on-demand geometry. Indexed source mapping, bounded
selection painting, shaping-input counters, and viewport accessibility-cell
capture are original GPUI Box work. No renderer or shader formats changed.

### Optional incremental editor syntax

The Kit `syntax` feature uses registry Tree-sitter 0.25.10 and the JSON grammar
0.24.8 (both MIT) through their public APIs. Revision-paired tree edits,
borrowed rope-byte input, viewport query projection, and editor event wiring
are original GPUI Box work. Other grammar crates are caller-selected; no
language server, workspace, process, or grammar download is owned by Kit.
The framework's borrowed byte-range iterator is product-neutral and does not
change platform input or renderer behavior. The frozen import receipt and
both workspaces' sole local GPUI authority remain unchanged.

### X11 native platform views

The X11 child/clip-window attachment, full-viewport toolkit allocation callback,
native hit-testing/stacking tests and lifetime restoration are original GPUI Box
framework work. They extend the existing macOS/Windows platform-view contract;
no Zed source synchronization or framework Git dependency is introduced. The
historical import receipt is unchanged. Native Wayland embedding and X11 scene
overlays above native children are not implemented; see crates/docs/webview.md.

### Native browser engines

`gpui-box-webview` uses the published Wry 0.57.0 API (Apache-2.0 OR MIT),
release tag `wry-v0.57.0`, commit `792d0359ba6501a4fc360ece17de2ae42329a47c`
in https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry. The wrapper, GTK allocation adapter,
WebView2 error subscription and WK delegate forwarding are original GPUI Box
integration, not copied Wry source. WKWebView, WebView2 and WebKitGTK retain
their operating-system/distribution engine authority. Cargo.lock records the
exact crates.io dependency checksums. No framework Git source, patch override,
or update to the frozen historical import is introduced.

### Opt-in renderer timing

The headless measurement contract, wgpu encoder timestamp queries and native
Metal command-buffer timing integration are original GPUI Box work over the
existing local renderer packages. No source was ported and the frozen import
receipt is unchanged. Normal rendering remains asynchronous. Completion waits,
query readback and pixel capture are not GPU execution or display latency.

### Accessible text indexing

Accessible text word-boundary indexing and bounded bidi-run scanning are
original GPUI Box modifications. They retain global Unicode segmentation
across visual rows and AccessKit run limits; no new external source, platform
API, or historical import receipt is introduced.

### Inherited effect ownership and host clipboard policy

Opaque `EffectOwner` tokens, the transparent element boundary, callback and
IME attribution, cache-owner invalidation, overlay retention and fallible
clipboard operations are original GPUI Box work. Authority is host policy,
never `KeyContext`, render entity identity, focus or a native gesture. Cached
dispatch closures carry their registration owner; reparenting forces fresh
registration. Asynchronous application re-entry and deferred notifications
start unowned unless the continuation explicitly restores a retained token.
Clipboard, Linux/FreeBSD primary selection and macOS find pasteboard legacy
wrappers enforce the same policy. No source was imported; the historical
receipt, renderer ABI and shared local package authority remain unchanged.

Primary-first multiple selections, grouped replacement/history, rectangular
painted hit testing, and nearest final-glyph caret correction are original
GPUI Box framework/Kit work. Native IME retains one authoritative replacement
range; no platform protocol or third-party source was changed.

Retained synthetic accessibility leaves, revision-keyed text publication, and
incrementally retained debug trees are original GPUI Box work using AccessKit's
existing node-level TreeUpdate contract. No new dependency or upstream source
was imported; local package authority and historical receipts remain intact.

### Built-in UI translation packs

`crates/gpui-kit/src/strings/packs.rs` contains original Simplified Chinese
translations authored for GPUI Box's existing English `StringKey` catalogue.
No external translation catalogue, translation-service output, or upstream
locale file was imported. English remains the existing source vocabulary;
the exhaustive translated match and placeholder tests keep both packs current.
Number/date adapters, text direction, and caller content are not translated by
these packs. Font sources and their notices remain unchanged.

Borrowed persistent-snapshot difference scanning and lazy Kit change-event
payloads are original GPUI Box work using Ropey's public chunk iterators.
Shared immutable byte spans skip comparisons without relying on private tree
layouts or changing the frozen import receipt.

### Native context-menu revision sessions

Opaque menu identities, completion/cancellation gates, captured effect-owner
dispatch, and NSMenu/Win32 cancellation are original GPUI Box modifications
to the locally owned framework. No upstream source or dependency was imported.
The frozen historical import receipt remains unchanged. Native tracking-loop
execution evidence must come from macOS/Windows, not shared Linux tests.

Incremental accessible paragraph publication, shared run payloads, and indexed
run-local native selection conversion are original GPUI Box work using the
existing Ropey, Unicode and AccessKit dependencies. No external source port,
adapter fork or historical receipt change is involved.

The native-menu lifecycle smoke and test-support tracking observation are
original GPUI Box work. They observe the existing NSMenu/Win32 call boundary
without introducing another implementation, imported source, or dependency.
The frozen historical import receipt remains unchanged.

### Typed owner scopes and directional wheel routing

`EffectScoped<T>` preserves typed child ownership through option transforms
until the existing full-lifecycle element boundary renders it. The removal
of horizontal-to-vertical wheel projection preserves independent axes in
nested tall row and column viewports. Both are original GPUI Box framework
changes; no renderer ABI, native event translator, imported source, package
authority or frozen historical receipt changed. Kit's exact-owner keyed
registry retirement and explicitly retained follow/glide continuations are
original component infrastructure over those primitives.

Owner cache lifetime uses explicit positive host mount registration rather
than historical tombstones. Active-owner and owner-group tables shrink after
removals; delayed callbacks never register owners. This original Kit change
introduces no upstream source or additional dependency.

### Opt-in native emoji review fixture

`fixtures/fonts/noto-color-emoji/NotoColorEmoji.ttf` is unmodified Noto Emoji
v2.042 from googlefonts/noto-emoji commit
`d79d23e6822e0f6e5731b114cbfb26b2a4e380da`, licensed under SIL OFL 1.1,
Copyright 2022 Google Inc. Its adjacent README records exact byte hashes and
source paths; OFL.txt preserves the upstream license. The original GPUI Box
`tools/app-host/src/review_fonts.rs` helper registers it only when explicitly
called for capture review. No default fonts or historical import receipt change.

Shared element-value publication and unchanged native parent/viewport-node
retention are original GPUI Box work using AccessKit's existing TreeUpdate
protocol. Complete changed values and relationship names remain available;
no AccessKit package fork, adapter modification or historical import update
is introduced. Producer value-copy counters exclude platform backend copies.

Persistent row-index identity and shared-source grapheme representability
caching are original GPUI Box work. Ropey's public instance comparison is
used without private storage assumptions, new dependencies or receipt changes.

The Win32 full-viewport toolkit allocation callback and WebView2 controller
bounds adapter are original GPUI Box corrections. They keep native child
position/clipping in the framework and toolkit content allocation in the host;
no upstream source was copied and the frozen import receipt is unchanged.

Native menu modal-loop scheduling corrections use existing NSRunLoop and
Win32 notification APIs. They are original GPUI Box modifications, with no
new imported code, package, or change to the frozen historical receipt.

Exact incremental paragraph wrapping and viewport-restricted editable geometry
are original GPUI Box work on the existing local text-system authority. They
reuse public Ropey snapshot differences and GPUI WrappedLine layout/painting;
no imported renderer, shader, platform adapter or historical receipt changed.

### Unified screen-space dielectric glass

The elliptical height field, thickness/index/optical-plane material parameters,
Snell-derived sampling bounds, spectral index variation and shared-normal
Fresnel environment response are original GPUI Box work in `scene.rs` and the
Metal, WGSL and HLSL renderers. They supersede the historical empirical
displacement cap and additive specular model described in P12, without changing
that import receipt. Kit presets, tokens and `glass-optics` are original work.

The implementation uses native shader intrinsics and a Schlick approximation;
it is a single-interface optical-plane model, not PBR volume tracing or Apple's
private material. No package, external source, or frozen revision changed.

### Native editable text geometry

Native editable selection fragments and visual cluster-edge navigation are
original GPUI Box work over retained WrappedLine glyph cells and wrap indices.
UIKit's public UITextInput/UITextSelectionRect documentation informed the
contract; no Apple source was copied. Existing Unicode dependencies resolve
graphemes and paragraph direction. Frozen import receipts are unchanged.
Affinity-aware native positions, atomic primary endpoint selection, and active
composition rollback are likewise original GPUI Box model/geometry work.
Incident-paragraph caret lookup reuses the existing indexed document and
retained shaping authority; it introduces no new source or dependency.

### Native glass reference acquisition and colour calibration

`tools/liquid-glass-reference` is independently authored reference acquisition,
validation and comparison code using public SwiftUI glass APIs and
ScreenCaptureKit. It does not copy Apple's renderer or sample implementation.
Native captures retain OS/SDK identity, exact source and fixture hashes, and
capture timing; synthetic tests and GPUI candidate images are identified
separately. Native surface resizing is not evidence of cross-view morphing;
queued AppKit events are not hardware input.

The colour-preserving `GlassMaterial::wash` sanitizer, Kit tint composition
and explicit body-text protection policy are original GPUI Box work. Existing
Metal, HLSL and WGSL colour-wash paths are reused without a material ABI change.
These changes do not alter the frozen historical import receipt or introduce
an external source/package authority. Reference observations do not establish
Apple-equivalent optics, volume transport or native-platform verification of
the GPUI implementation.

Two public implementations were reviewed on 2026-09-17 while separating
Regular Liquid scattering from Frost and correcting material-edge coverage:

- ybouane/liquidglass at `00aafe50202e916951d6f30d49afa1197ca236a7`,
  especially `src/defaults.ts`, `src/GlassRenderer.ts`, and `src/shaders.ts`;
- callstack/liquid-glass at `b7fd5abbabcd1dc5233d35c97c3f51bcb407d015`,
  especially the public Regular/Clear modes, tint/interactivity contract, and
  `UIGlassContainerEffect.spacing` bridge.

The former demonstrates a sharp-by-default WebGL material, separate optional
scattering, and antialiased SDF silhouette. The latter is a wrapper around
public UIKit effects and exposes no Apple shader or private optical constants.
GPUI Box does not copy either renderer: it retains its analytic signed-distance
field, Snell rays, spectral indices, Schlick Fresnel response, uniform scattering,
and caller-owned actions. The one-device-pixel coverage ramp reuses GPUI Box's
existing rounded-clip convention, and `effect.glassLiquidBlur = 8` is original
Kit policy chosen to retain visible structure while keeping Regular distinct
from 24 px Frost. Callstack's container spacing informed the review of optical
grouping versus child layout; GPUI Box retains and documents its own polynomial
smooth-union coefficient rather than claiming UIKit's private merge geometry.
No dependency, source import, or frozen receipt changed.

### Raw Cartesian coordinates and composition

`crates/gpui-kit/src/display/chart/{scale,data,cartesian}.rs` and the original
Cartesian fixtures are independently authored GPUI Box Kit code. Recharts and
ECharts are capability references, not source dependencies or compatibility
targets. The monotone Hermite implementation uses the mathematical
sign-preservation and radius-three tangent constraint described at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_cubic_interpolation (consulted 2026-09-13);
no example implementation or third-party source was copied. Time coordinates
are UTC Unix milliseconds with fixed-duration ticks, not a copied calendar
implementation. Existing GPUI layout, clipping, text measurement and pointer
capture are reused. No framework package or historical import receipt changes.
The sibling `cartesian_layout.rs` and `cartesian_motion.rs` implement original
shared orientation mapping and keyed f64 geometry using Kit's existing Transition
primitive. Caller tick lists and bounded custom painters add no imported source
or calendar policy. English and Chinese chart state strings are original text.
`cartesian_performance.rs`, its rectangle tree, immutable projection cache and
pixel-column extrema reduction, and the chart performance fixtures are original
Kit implementations. No external sampling or spatial-index source was copied.

### Balanced framework bounds index

The equal-leaf-depth overflow splitting, index-owned traversal and focused
workload/oracle tests in `crates/gpui/src/bounds_tree.rs` and its `bounds_tree/`
test directory are independently authored GPUI Box changes to the imported
framework index. No third-party R-tree implementation was copied. The original
file's upstream attribution and frozen historical import receipt remain intact;
no package authority, renderer ABI or dependency source changed.

### Measured descriptive semantic leaves

`crates/gpui-kit-semantics/src/measured.rs` and its mounted tests are original
GPUI Box work. They reuse the installed semantic coordinator and GPUI's existing
synthetic AccessKit children, identity hashing, visual transform and conservative
clip authority; no external implementation or additional registry was imported.
The accessibility debug JSON bounds field exposes already committed geometry
for verification without changing native publication. Package authority,
upstream attribution and frozen historical import receipts remain unchanged.

### Virtual-root layout placement

Window placement metadata, UniformList publication of its actual row slots,
and FLIP content-space sampling are original GPUI Box work. They distinguish
layout movement from ambient scroll/ancestor slides without a second renderer,
input transform or imported implementation. Frozen import receipts and package
authority remain unchanged.

### Atlas lease thread confinement

Target-specific release bounds preserve native cross-thread GPU completion
while keeping Wasm GPU resources thread-confined. The bound and native final-drop
test are original GPUI Box work; no unsafe Send wrapper, external source or new
dependency is introduced. Frozen import receipts remain unchanged.

### Focusable tooltip lifecycle

The focus-or-hover tooltip lifecycle, focus-tenure Escape dismissal and
displayed-bounds anchor are original GPUI Box framework work. They reuse GPUI's
existing focus, visual-transform and tooltip authorities without importing an
implementation, adding a dependency or changing the frozen historical import
receipt.

## P21: gpui-ce transition coordinate rebasing

The uniform scale, independent-axis scale, and translation contracts were
adapted into Kit's existing value transition rather than restoring gpui-ce's
window-owned transition state or creating another GPUI type universe. GPUI Box
also exposes the shared endpoint transform explicitly, supports `Bounds`, and
keeps its existing spring momentum, reduced-motion handling, scheduler clock,
and focused pure-state tests.

## P22: GPUI Component `Kbd` source port

The compact single-pill presentation, platform modifier ordering and notation,
filled/outline/plain appearances, and action-binding lookup helpers are adapted
from the source above. GPUI Box preserves its existing string constructor and
stable semantic ids, resolves visible key names through Kit strings, maps paint
and geometry to its token authority, and retains invalid caller input visibly.
No gpui-component package, theme, asset, or second GPUI type universe is added.
