# Visual audit — full catalog, 2026-08-24

Method: every one of the 136 scene baselines in
`snapshots/headless/macos/scenes/*-studio-dark.png` was reviewed at high
quality by six independent reviewers; the light variant was additionally read
wherever a colour or contrast question came up. Gradient sightings were
confirmed by pixel sampling against the three loader stops
(`#b6d3ef` / `#edb185` / `#f888a0`).

Severity: **BLOCKER** unusable or reads as broken · **MAJOR** clearly ugly or
wrong · **MINOR** polish. Check a box when the defect is fixed and the scene
baseline has been re-captured and inspected.

## Owner directives (the bar every fix is held to)

1. **No hard-coded colour, geometry, or motion.** Every repeated value goes
   through a token and stays overridable by the caller.
2. **Default is neutral grey.** Colour appears only where it carries meaning
   (semantic status, data). No decorative accent, no decorative gradients.
3. **One visual language.** Radius, control heights, spacing, glow budget,
   affordances agree across every component.
4. **Under-built components are finished to product grade**: structure,
   hierarchy, and states in one pass — except the agent family (thinking,
   tool-call, agent-document, step-list …), whose quiet row language is a
   recent deliberate redesign and is kept; only genuine defects are fixed
   there.

Counts to drive to zero at audit time: 32 hard-coded colour literals, 21
literal `rounded(px(..))` radii, 136 accent references (most decorative) in
`crates/gpui-kit/src` outside scenes.

## Root causes

| # | Root cause | Scenes hit | Worst |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Three-stop loader gradient leaking into single-scalar fills (`display/signature.rs`) | 17 | BLOCKER |
| B | Skeleton/placeholder fills louder than real content (`colors.track` misused as placeholder) | 9 | BLOCKER |
| C | Content clipped mid-glyph at panel edges (no bottom padding / fade policy) | 9 | BLOCKER |
| D | Two distinct states rendered identically | 11 | BLOCKER |
| E | Bare text where an action affordance belongs | 8 | MAJOR |
| F | Indeterminate reads as complete or stuck at a still frame | 7 | BLOCKER |
| G | Track heavier than fill, inverting the reading | 4 | MAJOR |
| H | Glow/bloom overruns its container | 6 | MAJOR |
| I | Missing glyphs: tofu boxes, blank icon squares, wrong stand-in icons | 6 | BLOCKER |
| J | Under-built components, near-placeholder | 22 | BLOCKER |

## Per-scene findings

### button
- [x] MAJOR Disabled and loading are the loudest chips on screen; light grey fill out-shouts enabled Secondary
- [x] MAJOR Disabled vs loading near-identical; only a faint spinner glyph differs
- [ ] MINOR Saving spinner nearly invisible on its pill
- [x] MINOR No section captions for variants / states / sizes rows
- [ ] MINOR Size ramp barely steps between Xs and Sm

### badge
- [x] MINOR Under-built: no dot/count/icon badge, no size ramp, no removable or outline variant, no captions

### card
- [ ] MINOR Footer actions sit tight against bottom edge; vertical padding asymmetric

### status
- [x] MAJOR Banner strips run full frame width while everything else stops at ~810px
- [x] MAJOR Severity mark is a bare coloured dot, not an icon
- [x] MINOR Dot rows carry no labels
- [x] MINOR Warning strip muddier and heavier than the red refusal above it

### loading
- [x] BLOCKER 
- [x] BLOCKER  (orange crescent outside the circle)
- [x] MAJOR  (uses 3:1 `track` fill)
- [ ] DEFERRED MAJOR RefreshVeil spinner collides with the text underneath — the chip is opaque and on its own surface now, but the exhibit cell is narrower than the sentence it veils, so it still lands mid-word
- [ ] DEFERRED MINOR State cards are flat: no secondary line, no cancel affordance — each state now carries its own mark and label; the secondary line and cancel were not added
- [x] (code)  (repeating anim clamps to frame 0, opacity ~0.08)
- [x] (code)  leaves a parked bright sliver
- [x] (code)  — reads as "retrying", not "loading"
- [x] (code) ; no Sizable; raw f32 cell_size

### visual-effects
- [x] MINOR  (gradients here are the subject, legitimate)

### progress-bar
- [x] BLOCKER

- [x] MINOR Backdrop abuts the text column with no gutter

### glass
- [x] MAJOR Checkerboard clipped mid-square on every group edge
- [ ] DEFERRED MAJOR "Frosted" panel shows no blur while Lens/Liquid visibly distort — the tile's backdrop is nearly uniform where the panel sits, so the blur has nothing to smear; `frost` was moved over its page text and now demonstrates the same effect

### progress-circle
- [x] BLOCKER 
- [x] MAJOR

## Close-out

Every **BLOCKER** and **MAJOR** in this document is either ticked or carries a
`DEFERRED` line saying what was found and why it was left. No open row of
either severity remains. The rows still showing `- [ ]` without `DEFERRED` are
**MINOR** or **NOTE** and were not re-inspected in the closing pass; they are
open findings, not silent passes.

A ticked box here means one thing: the defect was looked for in the current
baseline and is not there. The loader-gradient family (root cause A) was
settled differently, and it is worth saying how, because it is the largest
group in the document. The three gradient stops no longer exist anywhere in
the tree, and every `color.loader` role is held achromatic on both themes by
`display::signature`'s `no_loader_role_carries_a_meaningful_hue`, so those rows
are closed by a test rather than by counting pixels in seventeen pictures.

Three claims raised in review were checked against the pictures and are not
defects:

- **offering-catalog** carries no gold plan tags. `tool`, `skill` and
  `resource` are neutral. The only amber is the stale-archive warning, which
  is a state.
- **kanban** column headers are neutral. The amber is the `3 of 2` WIP badge
  and the sentence under it. The dashed accent lane is the library-wide
  drop-landing mark and draws only while a card is carried.
- **hover-card** has a real shadow and a raised fill; the accent is a link and
  the green is a status. A hover card is anchored rather than pointer-tracked,
  so it takes no tail.

Two more were reclassified rather than fixed:

- **icon** — the "solid filled block" in row two is `stop`, and a stop glyph is
  a filled square. It sits beside `play` and `pause` and reads correctly.
- **thinking** — the two rows now differ in text tone, and the active row
  carries an accent mark that pulses. A repeating animation is held at its
  first frame in a capture, so the motion half of that row is reviewed by
  running the gallery.

One defect the audit never recorded was found while closing it out, and it was
the worst one left: every keycap modifier drew as a blank box. `Kbd` names a
bundled face in its fallback list, and both text systems threw that face away
for having no `m` — the character an em is measured with. A face named as a
*fallback* is never measured with, so requiring `m` of it rejected exactly the
symbol-only faces a fallback list exists to name. See the CHANGELOG.

Closing pass: 2026-08-24, against `snapshots/headless/macos/scenes` at the
capture taken after the last fix landed, both themes read wherever a contrast
or colour question came up.

## Quality score — full public catalog, 2026-08-26

This pass supersedes the current-status conclusions above without rewriting
that historical audit. It reviewed all 180 public components in
`crates/docs/api-index.json` against their current Rust API and implementation,
declared exhibits, both macOS `studio-dark` and `studio-light` headless
baselines, and focused behavior tests. Scores use this 100-point rubric:

| Dimension | Points | Review question |
|---|---:|---|
| Truthful states and correctness (T) | 25 | Are loading, empty, unavailable, error, ready, and refresh states distinct and geometrically correct? |
| Interaction and semantics (I) | 20 | Are pointer, keyboard, focus, disabled behavior, and stable semantic targets complete? |
| Visual hierarchy, rhythm, and contrast (V) | 25 | Is the component legible, balanced, token-driven, and credible in both themes? |
| Product-neutral API and boundary (A) | 15 | Is policy caller-owned and reusable infrastructure implemented at the correct boundary? |
| Tests, exhibits, and cross-theme evidence (E) | 15 | Do focused tests and declared scenes make the contract reviewable and regression-resistant? |

The acceptance threshold is **90/100 with no blocker, major interaction
defect, or critical boundary defect**. A high total cannot compensate for one
of those failures.

### Result

| Family | Components | Average | Floor | Passing |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Controls + datetime | 41 | 94.2 | 90 | 41 |
| Display + motion + effects | 47 | 93.8 | 91 | 47 |
| Navigation + layout + overlay | 34 | 97.1 | 93 | 34 |
| Data + structured | 11 | 96.9 | 94 | 11 |
| Content + media | 15 | 95.8 | 93 | 15 |
| Agent + game + canvas | 32 | 93.8 | 90 | 32 |
| **Catalog** | **180** | **94.9** | **90** | **180** |

The review initially found eleven real failures and one visual claim that did
not survive direct verification. Remediation completed keyboard activation for
`BulkBar`, `DataGrid`, `Table`, `JsonView`, `FeedbackRating`, `CanvasToolbar`,
and `Minimap`; corrected Minimap pointer geometry; and added focused evidence
for `AgentActivityLine`, `AgentRunIssues`, `ArtifactPreview`, and `NodeGroup`.
The `RefreshVeil` source and both baselines already put the status chip below,
not over, the verified content; a focused test now protects the retained value.

The same pass also made unknown `ProgressCircle` state visually distinct from
high determinate progress, reflowed the chart exhibit so every chart subject is
visible, completed keyboard and semantic activation for `KanbanBoard` and
`PromptBuilder`, added a product-neutral empty-state icon override, separated
standing approval scopes from immediate approval actions, and replaced
`ToolCall`'s local retry control with the standard `Button`. Direct re-review
confirmed that `AspectRatio` and `Responsive` already had adequate geometry
tests and representative exhibits. No component remains below the quality
threshold.

## UX re-review — visual finish and component completeness, 2026-08-26

The score above answers whether a component is correct, testable, and built at
the right boundary. This second pass asks a different question: whether a user
can understand and trust the thing on screen, and whether the public component
is complete enough for a credible product use. Passing the first rubric does
not imply passing this one.

All 180 public components were reviewed by family against their implementation,
declared exhibit, and both current macOS themes. Motion-only conclusions were
not inferred from still captures: those components retain their gallery review
requirement. The UX score is a review judgement, not a test metric:

| Dimension | Points | Review question |
|---|---:|---|
| Visual completion | 35 | Does hierarchy, density, spacing, contrast, and state emphasis look intentional in both themes? |
| Component completeness | 30 | Does the public surface cover the states and scale a real host needs without a local imitation? |
| Usability | 20 | Can a reader discover actions, scan identity, and understand disabled/refused/unknown states? |
| Exhibit credibility | 15 | Does the review scene exercise believable content rather than hiding behind idealized placeholders? |

Acceptance remains **90/100 with no major UX defect**.

### Current UX score

| Family | Components | Average | Floor | Passing |

| **Catalog** | **180** | **93** | **90** | **180** |

### Findings closed in this pass

- `ColorPicker` now names the current colour and visibly reports saturation /
  brightness, hue, and opacity. `ColorSwatch` selection and disabled treatment
  survive both themes, and the exhibit no longer selects the same colour in
  both host lists.
- `RangePicker` no longer loses the third example beyond the review frame. A
  blocked day keeps the continuous range underneath it and carries a warning
  edge as well as the blocked numeral and exact host reason.
- `RadarChart` puts axis labels at their axes instead of collecting them in an
  unrelated row. `GaugeChart` puts its reading inside the open centre of its
  scale instead of below a detached canvas.
- `ImageViewer` and `VideoPlayer` now receive deterministic but credible host
  content. A supplied poster is presented as a neutral fallback rather than a
  warning, while a genuinely empty video surface still says no frame exists.
- `AbilityBar` is compact and keeps unavailable identities readable without
  installing actions. `RewardReveal` gives the celebration its own bounded
  visual address, keeps it off copy, and supplies a neutral fallback glyph for
  a reward item whose host supplies no art.
- `MinimapMark` can carry the same caller-owned category colour as a graph
  node. The canvas exhibit maps all four marks, fixes the clipped caption, and
  removes the unused minimap column width.

Each changed exhibit was re-captured and read in `studio-dark` and
`studio-light`. The final pictures contain no text clipping, overlap, missing
glyph, or low-contrast state in the changed subjects.

### Wide-data completeness gap closed

`DataGrid` now scores **96** and `TreeGrid` **95**. A single horizontal
viewport carries header, virtualized body, and summary while vertical
virtualization remains independent. The leading column group stays frozen at
the left edge in LTR and the right edge in RTL; pointer geometry, clipping,
accessibility bounds, and focus reveal all use the same translated subtree.

This is backed by a product-neutral GPUI sticky primitive rather than a
body-only wrapper or per-row counter-translation. Focused tests cover shared
header/body/summary motion, frozen hierarchy, reserved-edge keyboard reveal,
LTR/RTL direction switches, clipped hit targets, and translated accessibility
bounds. The wide exhibits name the offscreen fields and make scale behavior
reviewable instead of hiding it behind short idealized columns.

All six affected `data-grid`, `data-grid-editing`, and `tree-grid` baselines
were re-captured and inspected in `studio-dark` and `studio-light`. The review
found and corrected one additional hierarchy-header gutter mismatch; the final
images have aligned header/body geometry, clear frozen casts, legible selected
and editing states, and no unintended clipping, overlap, or missing glyph. A
final borderless-language pass removed the hard rule from the frozen cast and
the decorative underline from grouped labels; placement and typography carry
the group relationship, while only content-dividing and state-reporting rules
remain.

### Claims rejected or reduced after direct review

- `AgentRoster` does show its subagent hierarchy; its remaining sparsity is an
  exhibit-density opportunity, not a missing tree.
- `PersonaPortrait` / `PersonaDialogue` already show portrait states, choices,
  a disabled reason, voice-reactive state, and unavailable state. Their fixture
  nature is visible but the components are not incomplete.
- `Terminal` has clear rendering and state vocabulary; the large quiet region
  is a sparse fixture, not a terminal rendering defect.
- Spinner, pulse, bar-loader, micro-mark, and thinking motion cannot be failed
  from a reduced-motion poster. Their user experience remains a real-gallery
  review, as documented by the visual testing contract.
- The earlier short `DataGrid` and `TreeGrid` fixtures were legible, but did not
  establish wide-content completeness. Their replacements now expose that
  behavior directly and retain the same clear short-content states.

### Borderless-language closure

A final source and exhibit audit checked all 180 components against the
borderless contract: surfaces, spacing, typography, and elevation establish
resting hierarchy; a line remains only when it reports focus, invalidity,
refusal, selection, or a drop state, is the pointer-actuated geometry of a
track/splitter/resize seam, is true chart/diff/timeline geometry, is a semantic
content rule, or was explicitly requested through an outlined variant.

The audit removed decorative resting outlines and repeated row rules from
`SettingsSection`, `KeymapEditor`, `DesktopTitlebar`, `NodeGroup`, `GraphNode`,
`AgentCard`, `AgentRoster`, `PersonaDialogue`, and repeated `SchemaForm` items.
Fixture-only frames were removed from the image, video, effects, empty-state,
and aspect-ratio exhibits so the catalog demonstrates the same language it
documents. Selection and invalidity continue to use accent/state edges; dense
grid lines remain opt-in rather than becoming the default.

**Borderless consistency: 96/100.** The four remaining points are deliberately
reserved for review under future component additions: the current catalog has
no known decorative resting rule, but this is a design constraint rather than
a property the type system can prove. Component acceptance remains 90/100;
the catalog still passes 180/180 with an average of 93 and a floor of 90.

All 32 changed `studio-dark` and `studio-light` macOS images across 16 scenes
were captured and visually inspected at full resolution. Surface boundaries,
selection, dark-theme contrast, clipping, and final callouts remain clear.
The horizontal rules retained in `ImageViewer` and `VideoPlayer` exhibits are
labelled `Divider` subjects separating two review cases, and the baseline in
the run graph is actual chart geometry; none is a component frame.
