//! A strip of tabs that reports which one was chosen.
//!
//! The selected tab is caller-owned. `Tabs` reports the id that was picked and
//! renders whatever the caller says is current, so a host that refuses a move
//! keeps the tab that still holds selected.
//!
//! `Tabs` renders the strip only. The body belongs to the caller, which is why
//! no `Role::TabPanel` node is published here.
//!
//! # Document tabs
//!
//! A document tab is this same strip carrying two more facts: whether the
//! thing behind it has changes nobody has written down yet ([`SaveState`]),
//! and whether it can be put away ([`TabItem::closable`]). It is not a second
//! component, because everything a document tab does — reporting a selection
//! it does not apply, refusing a tab, stepping with the arrow keys in reading
//! order, being dragged somewhere else — is what this strip already does. A
//! separate `DocumentTabs` would have to reimplement all of it and would then
//! be a second place for the two of them to disagree about what a tab is.
//!
//! A strip too wide for its frame does one of two things, and the caller
//! says which: it moves the surplus into a menu ([`Tabs::overflow_after`]) or
//! it scrolls ([`Tabs::scrolling`]). Neither hides a tab from the keyboard.
