//! Read-only Markdown, rendered to GPUI elements.
//!
//! # What this component will not do
//!
//! **It does not execute HTML, and it does not swallow it.** A fragment of raw
//! HTML is rendered as the literal characters that were written, marked as
//! unrendered. Interpreting it would let a document reach outside the reader's
//! text; dropping it would let a document delete its own content from view by
//! wrapping it in a tag, which is worse than showing the tag.
//!
//! **It does not open links.** A link shows its destination before it is
//! taken — in the node it publishes and in hover help — and reports
//! [`MarkdownEvent::LinkClicked`]. Whether that destination may be opened, and
//! by what, is the host's to decide.
//!
//! **It does not fetch images.** This crate has no network and no asset
//! resolution. An image is drawn as a placeholder naming its alt text and its
//! source, and reported once as [`MarkdownEvent::ImageRequested`]; a host that
//! has the bytes hands an element back through [`Markdown::image`].
//!
//! **It does not guess at syntax.** A code block is set in the mono face and
//! publishes the fence's info string exactly as it was written. Colour comes
//! from host-supplied [`CodeSpan`]s or from nowhere.
