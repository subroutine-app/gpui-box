//! Prose and conversation: the two surfaces that draw content nobody in this
//! crate wrote.
//!
//! Both take text from somewhere else — a document, a model, another person —
//! which is what makes them different from the rest of the library. A button's
//! label is written by the application; a Markdown document's contents are
//! not, and may contain a tag, a destination, or an image reference that would
//! act on the reader if anything here acted on it.
//!
//! So nothing here acts. Raw HTML is shown as the characters it is, links
//! report rather than open, images are named rather than fetched, and code
//! changes colour but never shape. `crates/docs/content.md` states the
//! whole posture, and the delivery vocabulary a conversation speaks.
//!
//! The two media surfaces keep the same posture from the other side. Nothing
//! is fetched, so [`ImageViewer`] draws what the host handed it and names what
//! it did not; nothing is played, so [`TransportBar`] reports every control
//! and moves no head. A duration nobody knows is a state, not a zero.
//!
//! Code is the one place the crate reads what it was given rather than only
//! showing it, and [`highlight`] states exactly how far that goes: four
//! classes found by looking, on a language the writer named, changing colour
//! and nothing else.
