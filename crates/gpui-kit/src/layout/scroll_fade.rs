//! Content that fades out where it runs off the edge of its region.
//!
//! [`ScrollFade`] says the same thing the shadow along the top of a
//! [`ScrollArea`](crate::layout::ScrollArea) says — there is more content past
//! this edge — and says it where a shadow cannot: over a translucent or
//! frosted surface, where "the colour of what is behind the window" is not a
//! colour anything can paint. Instead of covering content with a gradient, the
//! fade evaluates painted primitives against the active edge. All primitives
//! participate by default; [`ScrollFade::text_only`] limits attenuation to glyphs,
//! emoji and their decorations so a surface does not turn into a vignette.
//!
//! The edges are the caller's statement about overflow, not this component's
//! guess: a region scrolled to its end fades at the start edge only, and one
//! that fits fades at neither. Reading those from
//! [`scroll_offset`](crate::layout::scroll_offset) keeps the fade truthful,
//! and turning both on unconditionally would tell the reader there is content
//! past an edge where there is none.
//!
//! A fade is information rather than decoration, so it is not suppressed under
//! reduced motion; it does not animate, and nothing about it moves on its own.
