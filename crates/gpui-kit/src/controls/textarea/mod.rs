//! A multi-line editable text control.
//!
//! `TextArea` is a view rather than a `RenderOnce` builder, for the same
//! reason [`crate::controls::input::TextInput`] is: the caret, the selection,
//! the in-progress input method composition, and the viewport all outlive a
//! frame. Ordinary text wraps at the width the control was given. A source
//! editor can instead select [`TextAreaWrap::None`], which keeps hard lines
//! intact and reveals the caret through the same geometry used by hit testing,
//! accessibility, selection, and input methods.
//!
