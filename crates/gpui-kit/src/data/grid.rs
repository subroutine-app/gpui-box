//! A virtualized, column-oriented grid over caller-owned rows.
//!
//! [`crate::data::Table`] takes materialized rows, so every cell element
//! already exists by the time the table sees it and every row it is given is
//! laid out. `DataGrid` takes a *render closure* instead — the same shape
//! [`crate::data::List`] uses — so the body can live inside
//! [`gpui::uniform_list`] and only the rows the viewport holds are ever built.
//!
//! Everything the grid shows is the caller's answer. Order, sort, column
//! widths, column order, selection, expansion, and the value in an editing
//! cell are all host state; the grid reports what was operated and renders
//! exactly what it was handed back, so a host that refuses a change keeps
//! showing the state that still holds.
//!
//! # Which nodes publish
//!
//! Only the rows the viewport drew publish nodes. The grid node itself carries
//! the number of rows it was given in `value`, which is how a snapshot stays
//! honest about the difference between twelve thousand rows and the fourteen
//! that are on screen. A cell publishes a [`Role::Cell`] node only where the
//! caller marks it with [`Cell::published`] or declares its column editable.
//!
//! Wide grids scroll horizontally as one surface, so the header, virtualized
//! body, and summary always share one column geometry. [`GridColumn::pinned`]
//! holds the leading group at the reading edge while the remaining columns
//! move beneath it. The body keeps its own vertical virtualization handle;
//! the two axes never synchronize independent lists or write each other's
//! offsets.
//!
//! Unpinned columns outside the horizontal viewport become width-only gaps.
//! [`GridRow::cells_with`] avoids building their values; eager [`GridRow::cell`]
//! remains compatible but cannot recover work already done by the caller.
//! Pinned columns, the active editor/navigation cell in a mounted row, and at
//! most two keyboard entry headers per omitted run stay mounted. Column
//! descriptors and prefix widths are metadata proportional to column count;
//! cell construction and element layout are bounded by the viewport.
//!
//! **It does not measure a column to its content.** A double click on a
//! resize handle reports a fit request and stops: the grid can only measure
//! the rows it drew, and a width fitted to fourteen of twelve thousand rows is
//! a guess wearing a measurement's clothes. The host owns the data and can
//! answer properly.
