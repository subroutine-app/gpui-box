//! A virtualized list over a caller-owned data set.
//!
//! The list never holds the rows. It asks the caller to render one index at a
//! time, and the caller stamps each row with the business identity that row
//! already has, so a semantic id never encodes where the row happens to sit.
//!
//! # Only rendered rows are published
//!
//! Virtualization means the window holds a viewport, not a data set. A row
//! outside the viewport is not laid out, has no bounds, and publishes no
//! semantic node, so a test can only assert what is on screen. The list node
//! itself carries the total in `value`, which is how a test states the honest
//! version: a thousand items exist, twelve of them are rendered.
//!
//! Virtualization needs a bounded viewport, from a row count or from the
//! surface that holds the list ([`List::fills`]). With [`List::visible_rows`] the
//! list renders only the rows that fit; without it the list sizes itself to
//! its content and every row is laid out.
