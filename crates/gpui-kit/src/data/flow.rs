//! A virtualized surface whose rows are exactly what the caller drew.
//!
//! [`List`](crate::data::List) answers "show me these rows" and decides what a
//! row looks like: it pads it, gives it a hover and a selected state, and
//! publishes a row node for it. A conversation, a log and a diff answer a
//! different question. Their rows are not entries in a list — they are turns,
//! lines and hunks, each with its own shape, its own spacing rule and its own
//! identity — and a container that wraps them in list chrome is describing
//! something they are not.
//!
//! What those surfaces still need is everything virtualization is: only the
//! screenful is laid out, a row is measured once and that measurement survives
//! the next frame, and the surface can be scrolled, revealed, glided and
//! followed by name. That is this. A `Flow` draws the element the caller
//! returns and nothing else around it, and registers the measured state under
//! the caller's identity, so [`follow_end`](crate::motion::follow_end),
//! [`scroll_to_row`](crate::data::scroll_to_row),
//! [`reveal_row`](crate::data::reveal_row) and
//! [`glide_to_row`](crate::data::glide_to_row) all reach it the same way they
//! reach a list.
//!
//! `List`'s own variable-height mode is a `Flow` whose rows happen to be list
//! rows, which is the honest relationship between the two: one is a surface,
//! the other is what a surface is made of.
//!
//! # A flow publishes nothing
//!
//! Every other surface here publishes a container node carrying its total and
//! a node per row. A flow cannot: it did not build the rows and has no idea
//! what they are, and a node it invented would name a row that the caller
//! already named something else. So the caller publishes both, exactly as it
//! would if it were laying the rows out itself — which is the only version
//! where the ids in a snapshot are the ids the product uses.
//!
//! # Name the rows
//!
//! A flow only learns a row's height by laying it out, and what it has learned
//! is addressed by index. [`Flow::keys`] says which indices still mean what
//! they meant, so a turn arriving at the end re-measures that turn instead of
//! discarding every height above it. A flow that only counts its rows keeps
//! the blunter rule and loses its measurements whenever the count changes in
//! any way but growing.
