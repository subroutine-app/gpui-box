//! One canonical rendering per component, grouped the way the components are.
//!
//! A scene is the single description of a component's states that both the
//! gallery and the audit tests consume, so a component cannot be reviewed
//! visually in one arrangement and tested in another.
//!
//! Almost every scene is an *exhibit*: it is about one component, it lives in
//! the file named after that component's family, and it is where a reader is
//! sent to review it. `xtask api check` fails when a public component has no
//! exhibit, so a component cannot be added and left unseen.
//!
//! The rest are *compositions*, and there are three of them. A composition is
//! built the way a product would build one, because components interact in
//! ways none of them shows alone. It is nobody's coverage, and [`Shows`]
//! records the difference so the catalog does not claim a component was
//! reviewed when it was only recognised inside a shell.
//!
//! What is deliberately not here is a scene per screenshot. The files below
//! are the component families, not a taxonomy invented for this module, so a
//! component and the rendering that reviews it move together.
