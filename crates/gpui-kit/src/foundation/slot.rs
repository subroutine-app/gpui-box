//! Replacing a node a component authored, rather than configuring it.
//!
//! A builder lets a caller change what a component was told. It does not let
//! a caller change what the component decided, and some of those decisions
//! are nodes: the empty state a list shows when it has nothing, the failure
//! it shows when a load failed, the control a toolbar puts its overflow
//! behind. Those are complete little components in their own right, and a
//! host that needs one of them to be its own — with its own wording, its own
//! action, its own illustration — has no way to say so through a setter.
//!
//! Before this existed, components that felt the pressure grew a private
//! escape hatch each: `DataGrid` took a `vacancy`, others took nothing and
//! the caller worked around the component. One named mechanism replaces all
//! of them, so a reader who has learned it once has learned it everywhere.
//!
//! A slot name is a `&'static str` a component publishes as an associated
//! constant, and [`Slotted::slot`] rejects a name the component does not
//! declare. That rejection is a panic rather than a silent no-op on purpose:
//! a filled slot that renders nothing looks exactly like a component that
//! ignored you, and the caller has no way to tell the two apart.
