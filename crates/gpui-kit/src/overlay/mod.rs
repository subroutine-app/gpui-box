//! Floating surfaces that render above the page.
//!
//! [`Overlay`] owns placement, stacking and dismissal; [`FocusTrap`] keeps the
//! keyboard inside an open overlay and gives focus back when it closes.
//! [`Dialog`] composes both into a modal that asks one question, [`Drawer`] is
//! the same surface arriving from an edge, and [`Tooltip`] is hover-delayed
//! help that is never the only way to act.
//! [`ToastLayer`] holds transient notifications, which report what happened
//! and never hide a failure on a timer.
//!
//! [`Positioner`] answers which side an anchored surface lands on and how
//! much room it has there, for a surface that has to be built to fit before
//! anything is painted.
//!
//! [`Popover`] is the anchored surface the menu family is built from:
//! [`Menu`] hangs one off a trigger, [`ContextMenu`] opens the same list at
//! the pointer, and [`CommandPalette`] filters it from the keyboard.
