//! A surface that shows what is behind it, out of focus and bent.
//!
//! [`Glass`] is the material a popover, a dialog or a rail is placed on when
//! the window itself is translucent. Regular Liquid refracts the scattered
//! (blurred) source at its rim: colour bands and luminance bend there, not
//! recognizable background details. Clear and Lens stay sharp because their
//! default blur is zero; Frosted scatters without bending the backdrop.
//!
//! # One layer, in one order
//!
//! The whole subtree paints inside a single scene layer, which is the reason
//! `BackdropLayer` is an element and not a styled `div`. Paint order is
//! per-primitive otherwise, so a repaint elsewhere in the frame can reorder
//! the surface's own quads underneath the blur — a divider or a border is then
//! snapshotted and blurred away, intermittently, in a way no test reproduces.
//! Inside one layer the relationship is structural: surface first, fill and
//! content after.
//!
//! Regular Liquid owns its blur, saturation and achromatic wash in the
//! material, not in a source-over fill. Clear is reserved for media, with a
//! dimming layer behind it. Adaptive appearance is a small-control policy;
//! large reading surfaces retain the window appearance.
//!
//! `crates/docs/coverage.md` records which renderer does which of these today.
