//! A surface that shows what is behind it, out of focus.
//!
//! [`Frost`] is [`Glass`] with [`GlassPreset::Frosted`]: the
//! pixels underneath are blurred and the surface colour is laid over the blur
//! at `effect.glassAlpha`, and nothing about the backdrop is bent, split into
//! colour or lit. It is the material to reach for when a surface must look the
//! same on every renderer, because a blur is the one backdrop capability they
//! all have.
//!
//! Everything else — the backdrop layer followed by normally ordered content,
//! the opaque-theme path that paints no blur at all, and where the
//! backdrop does not exist — is described on [`super::glass`], because this is
//! that module's material with its optics turned off.
