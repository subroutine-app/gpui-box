//! A run drawn as connected steps on a canvas.
//!
//! This is the shape an agent's work takes when it stops being a list: steps
//! as cards, connections as paths, and the failures that sent work back drawn
//! as the loops they are rather than flattened into the forward order.
//!
//! The division of labour is the same one the rest of the library keeps. The
//! caller owns the run, the positions and the actions; the canvas owns the
//! backdrop, the card, the path geometry and the states. There is no layout
//! algorithm here on purpose: where a step belongs is a claim about the run,
//! and a component that placed steps itself would be making that claim on
//! every host's behalf.
//!
