//! Sliding an element from where it was to where it now is.
//!
//! FLIP is the standard trick for animating a layout change: read where the
//! element was (First), let layout put it where it belongs (Last), Invert that
//! difference into a visual offset, and Play the offset back to zero. Nothing
//! about the layout changes — a reordered row lands in its new slot on the
//! frame the caller reorders it; child paint, hit targets and semantic bounds
//! follow the displayed position while sibling layout stays settled.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use gpui::{App, Window, div, prelude::*};
//! # use gpui_kit::motion::{Flipping, flip};
//! # fn row(id: &'static str, window: &mut Window, cx: &mut App) -> impl IntoElement {
//! let handle = flip(id, window, cx);
//! div().child("Row").flip(&handle, window, cx)
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The offset is applied during prepaint through [`gpui::Window::with_element_offset`],
//! after layout has already run, so it cannot move a sibling. The origin the
//! element is measured against excludes the ambient element offset, so
//! scrolling a list — which offsets every row at once — is not mistaken for a
//! reorder.
//!
//! # Position and size are not the same promise
//!
//! [`Flipping::flip`] animates position only, and that is free: an offset
//! applied after layout has no box to push, so nothing beside the element can
//! move.
//!
//! [`Flipping::flip_size`] additionally animates size, and that is **not**
//! free. This is real assigned border-box layout, not a scaled picture:
//! descendants reflow at the displayed size and siblings can move with it.
//! Authored root constraints return for natural measurement. Padding/border
//! minima and device rounding determine the actual size reported by the handle;
//! negative spring overshoot is bounded at zero. Ask for it deliberately, on
//! an element whose neighbours can stand being pushed.
