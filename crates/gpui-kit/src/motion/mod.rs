//! Motion primitives that respect the user's reduced-motion preference.
//!
//! The layers build on each other:
//!
//! - [`CubicBezier`] and [`Easing`] name curves;
//! - [`Spring`] solves physical motion in closed form;
//! - [`MotionSpec`] pairs a curve with a duration and delay;
//! - [`MotionRole`] names why a component moves and [`MotionPolicy`] resolves
//!   that reason into the one theme-backed specification and reduced-motion
//!   answer every component shares;
//! - [`Interpolate`] moves a value between two states, while [`ScaleAxes`]
//!   re-expresses compound geometry when its coordinate space changes;
//! - [`Keyframes`] takes a value through named stops rather than straight
//!   across;
//! - [`Transition`] animates a value whose target can change mid-flight,
//!   carrying the speed it already had across a retarget;
//! - [`VelocityTracker`] measures how fast a gesture is moving, which is what
//!   [`flick`], [`rubber_band`] and [`Transition::release`] need;
//! - [`ScrollLink`] reads a scroll offset as a progress, which is motion with
//!   no clock in it at all;
//! - [`Glide`] eases toward a target whose distance is not known until you
//!   arrive, which is what scrolling a virtualized list to a row far off
//!   screen is;
//! - [`follow_end`] holds a growing surface against its own end, with a
//!   [`Chase`] whose target keeps moving and which a gesture, not arriving
//!   content, interrupts;
//! - [`Presence`] keeps an element alive long enough to animate out, and plays
//!   a phase backwards from where it had got to when the other cancels it;
//! - [`Presenting`] is that lifecycle wearing one [`MotionRole`], which is
//!   what a floating surface needs, and [`presenting`] is what it looks like
//!   partway through — the appearance the `*_in` helpers apply, taken out of
//!   the one-way timeline that keeps them from running backwards;
//! - [`Stagger`] spreads one specification across a group, forwards or in
//!   reverse;
//! - [`Sequence`] runs specifications one after another and knows how long
//!   they take together;
//! - [`Motion`] writes a motion down instead of hiding it in the closure that
//!   applies it, so what a run looks like at any point in it can be sampled
//!   without a window; [`motion!`](crate::motion!) and
//!   [`sequence!`](crate::sequence!) are how one is written;
//! - [`Animator`] holds a run open as a playhead that can be played, paused,
//!   reversed and scrubbed, and costs nothing while it is not moving;
//! - [`Flipping::flip`] slides an element from where it was to where it is,
//!   and [`Flipping::flip_size`] additionally resizes it;
//! - [`Animated::animate_in`] puts any of this on an element in one call,
//!   which is the layer most components should reach for.
//!
//! Motion never changes what a surface publishes. A slide, a press response
//! and a counting number are all painted over a layout, a hit target and a
//! semantic tree that already report the settled value.
//!
//! Decorative motion built on GPUI's `with_animation` already stops when
//! [`gpui::App::reduce_motion`] is set. [`Transition::animate`] and
//! [`Presence::animate`] honor the same preference by finishing immediately.
