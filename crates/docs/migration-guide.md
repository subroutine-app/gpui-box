# Migration guide

This guide moves an existing GPUI application onto the `gpui-box` framework
and `gpui-box-kit` component library without a big-bang shell rewrite.

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui = { package = "gpui-box", version = "0.1" }
gpui_kit = { package = "gpui-box-kit", version = "0.1" }
```

## Native windows and platform views

GPUI has two different window-handle contracts. The inherent
`gpui::Window::window_handle()` method returns GPUI's `AnyWindowHandle`, which
updates a window through the application context. The
`raw_window_handle::HasWindowHandle` implementation returns the operating
system handle. Rust resolves an inherent method before a trait method, so
importing `HasWindowHandle` is not enough when obtaining a Win32 or AppKit
handle. Call the trait explicitly:

```rust
let raw = raw_window_handle::HasWindowHandle::window_handle(window)?;
```

For a native child such as WKWebView or WebView2, keep construction, navigation,
focus, and destruction in the application, convert the native view once, and
let GPUI own its placement:

```rust
// macOS, after constructing a retained NSView/WKWebView:
let handle = unsafe { gpui::PlatformViewHandle::from_ns_view(native_view) };

// Windows, after constructing a child HWND:
let handle = unsafe { gpui::PlatformViewHandle::from_hwnd(child_hwnd) };

// Both platforms:
gpui::platform_view(handle).size_full()
```

Remove direct `addSubview`/`SetParent` placement code and per-frame native
geometry synchronization. The application remains the native view's owner;
GPUI owns layout, clipping, stacking, visibility, and detach timing. See the
complete macOS example in `crates/gpui/examples/native_webview.rs`.

A partially visible view retains the full frame GPUI laid out. GPUI applies the
current content mask through a clipped AppKit container or the Windows host
region, so scrolling crops native content rather than changing its layout. A
view painted more than once uses its last paint and native views are restacked
in paint order every time that order changes.

When a controller or service destroys the native view on drop, attach that
owner to the handle so the detach frame cannot race destruction:

```rust
let handle = unsafe { gpui::PlatformViewHandle::from_hwnd(child_hwnd) }
    .keep_alive(native_controller.clone());
```

`keep_alive` does not transfer native ownership to GPUI. It retains the
caller-owned value until the platform host drops its final handle clone, on the
window's platform thread.

## 1. Inventory

Classify current code:

- raw palette and repeated metrics;
- product-neutral primitives;
- reusable interaction patterns;
- product view models and actions;
- host, persistence, process, and credential authority;
- automation and screenshot infrastructure.

Only the first three categories migrate to the kit.

## 2. Establish visual baselines

Capture fixed viewports for important states before changing dependencies.
Record hover, selected, disabled, focus, loading, empty, error, stale, popover,
and dialog states.

## 3. Map tokens

Add a theme document or map the existing design to `studio-dark`. Do not keep
an old theme global active beside `gpui_kit_theme::Theme`.

Replace:

```rust
const PANEL: u32 = 0x0d0d0d;
```

with:

```rust
let theme = Theme::get(cx);
theme.colors.panel
```

`Theme` is a cheaply cloned handle to immutable `ThemeData`. Existing reads
stay direct, but code that derived an adjusted theme by writing a cloned field
must use the copy-on-write boundary:

```rust
let branded = Theme::get(cx)
    .clone()
    .modify(|theme| theme.colors.accent = brand);
```

This is also the adjustment callback expected by `ThemeOverlay`. Do not mutate
the raw palette outside `Theme::modify`; that method rebuilds the pre-resolved
palette and variant-ramp lookups when the palette changes.

## 4. Install assets and theme

```rust
let app = gpui_platform::application()
    .with_assets(gpui_kit::assets::Assets);

app.run(|cx| {
    gpui_kit::install(cx);
    // Open application windows.
});
```

Applications with their own assets can compose or delegate an `AssetSource`.

## 5. Migrate low-coupling primitives

Move in this order:

1. badges and status;
2. buttons;
3. cards and settings scaffolding;
4. loaders and motion;
5. popovers and dialogs;
6. frost and edge fade.

After each move, delete the application copy. Do not retain two primitive sets.

## 6. Add semantic IDs

Install Kit once. Its `SemanticCoordinator` creates and removes one frame
context per GPUI window, but records nodes only while a diagnostic consumer is
armed. A harness, inspector, or automation host retains
`SemanticCoordinator::global(cx).arm()` for its lifetime; ordinary installation
deliberately leaves diagnostic recording dormant while native accessibility
remains active. At the top of
each root render call `SemanticCoordinator::global(cx).begin_frame(window)`,
then attach `NodeSpec` to every action and assertion target with `semantic_in`.
Keep application IDs in the application; the library does not define product
vocabulary.

## 7. Preserve the host boundary

Convert product models into view models before rendering. Components must not
gain direct host references merely to simplify migration.

## 8. Replace automation

Use semantic generation to wait for frames, target controls by stable id, and
capture the owned window. Keep any RPC server and input injection debug-only.

## 9. Remove duplicates

Search for:

- second Theme globals;
- copied RGB or alpha values;
- duplicate Loadable enums;
- duplicate popover geometry;
- multiple semantic registries;
- full-desktop screenshot code.

The migration is complete only after the old implementation is gone.

## Forge-specific note

Forge integration is intentionally not part of this repository's initial
implementation. A future Forge migration should happen through a reviewed
dependency update while preserving Forge's product and host authority.
