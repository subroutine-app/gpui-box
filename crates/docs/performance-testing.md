# Deterministic performance testing

GPUI Box treats performance shape as a compatibility contract. A large data
set must not make a bounded viewport mount, lay out, paint, or publish every
item. The authority check is:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- performance check
```

GPU execution timing has a separate [renderer timing authority](../tools/renderer-timing/README.md).
It compares raw same-adapter workload intervals, never CPU time or a
same-renderer calibration ratio. Structural budgets below do not substitute
for GPU measurements; an inconclusive timing comparison is not equivalence.
The root gate runs the renderer comparator's regression tests, not a noisy
wall-clock performance acceptance test on every build.

The structural performance command writes a machine-readable report to
`target/performance/report.json`. Each rendering fixture is warmed for two
explicit redraws and measured on the third. The report covers 1,000- and 10,000-item fixtures with identical viewport budgets for
List, DataGrid, TreeGrid, CodeView, LogStream, and AgentDocument. It also draws
a fully visible 64-node graph split between 32 zero-snapshot resting materials
and 32 promoted glass requests. That promoted set deliberately exceeds the
renderer admission limit, proving the bounded backdrop/fill-fallback path under
the same structural budget. A static theme-and-semantics fixture publishes 128
Buttons and Badges on palette-backed presentation tiers so render-path theme
resolution and diagnostic semantics have a heap-allocation ratchet. An idle
fixture renders twice, then only drains already-scheduled work; it fails if the
window's frame index advances without an invalidation. The command additionally renders a deliberately
unbounded 10,000-child fixture and fails if the budget does not reject it.

## Wide grids are measured on both axes

The `wide-data-grid` reports use 10,000 rows and either 1,000 or 10,000
columns in an 870-pixel viewport, with 24 visible 31.5-pixel rows. Columns
mix 180-pixel flexible minimums with fixed widths from 180 to 366 pixels.
Every column is sortable, resizable, and editable; the leading column is
pinned. Each direction is measured at the start, column/row 703, and the last
column. Header, body, and summary share the column geometry.

The existing layout/paint/semantic budgets are unchanged. The new interactive
wide-grid case has its own allocation ratchet: 12,140 calls, the observed
11,036-call maximum plus a 10% integer ceiling. It builds 104–130 cells per
measured frame (explicit ceiling 192), with at most 752 layout calls and 169
semantic nodes in these cases. The row-builder counter is separate from the
cell-builder counter: neither disguises descriptor or eager-cell conversion.

Use `GridRow::cells_with` for wide data. The provider receives a column key
and builds its `Cell` only when mounted or explicitly requested by range copy.
Existing `.cell` entries override the provider and retain their eager cost;
filtering after the row callback cannot undo their construction. The legacy
three-column grid cases report `caller_eager_cell_conversions` separately.
Wide cases report zero eager cells and `caller_column_conversions` equal to
the number of column descriptors cloned to supply each frame. Descriptor
preparation, prefix geometry, and navigation metadata remain column-count
sized; this is a cell/element-work bound, not constant-time ingestion or
constant retained bytes.

Pinned columns remain mounted. At most two actionable header entry points
per omitted run preserve forward/reverse Tab access. An editor or the active
keyboard-navigation cell remains mounted horizontally while its row is
mounted. Header/body/summary gaps carry exact logical widths, including RTL;
wide header reorder animations do not interpolate away from body geometry.
`scroll_to_cell(row_index, column_key)` performs nearest-edge reveal on both
axes once per changed request, without selecting or editing data. Editing a
new target also reveals it; locating its caller-owned row identity and range
copy/changed-range resolution can scan row metadata. Rows retain the existing
uniform-height contract; this does not implement per-row variable heights.

The grid integration suite covers mixed widths, far-cell reveal, RTL pinned
geometry, real focused semantic nodes after navigation, header Tab traversal,
editing Tab across an omitted run, and range copy through the lazy provider
with eager overrides. Offscreen data cells are absent from the semantic tree,
apart from the bounded active-cell retention described above. The grid node
continues to publish the caller's total row count.

## Mounted Markdown and editable documents

Separate `markdown-history`, `textarea-no-wrap`, and `editor-json` reports
exercise the real components, with native accessibility enabled, at 1,000
and 10,000 records. They do not replace the original plain-text AgentDocument
fixture or change any existing allocation ratchet.

Markdown history contains distinct message identities and parsed emphasis and
inline code. A static redraw must add zero parser passes, parsed/copied bytes,
or planned rows; its input comparisons are explicitly linear in message count.
The next two phases insert a new 21-byte Markdown message and append another
21 bytes to that same source. Parser work must be exactly one pass and 21/42
parsed bytes respectively; each update copies exactly 21 source bytes.
The new message constructs exactly one row plan. Appending its second
paragraph constructs exactly two: the first paragraph becomes non-last (its
spacing/streaming metadata changes) and the new tail needs its own row.
All history row plans stay retained; List metadata vectors and caller input
comparisons remain history-sized work. Matching phases must have identical
shaping/parser/planning and layout/prepaint/paint/semantic counts at both sizes.
These phases include scrolling to the new tail and settling its redraw;
semantic assertions prove the streamed message is mounted. Allocation and
caller-conversion observations include every render in those phases, not
just the final frame whose structural counters are checked.
These small per-message sources exercise the synchronous retained-plan path,
not background parsing of a single source above the worker threshold.

TextArea and JSON Editor retain their entities and use an eight-row no-wrap
viewport. Each corpus has Unicode JSON records and a distinct final object.
Cases measure static redraw, an actual one-digit replacement, a 173-pixel
wheel scroll, and selecting the complete source. Checks verify edited bytes,
unchanged source length, the scroll displacement, and the selected range.
Shaping must stay between one and nine lines and below nine source-row byte
lengths, including selection. The Editor's real incremental JSON parser must
offer fewer than 65,536 bytes after the local replacement. Offered bytes count
repeated parser reads, not copies or total parsing CPU work.

Caller strings are prepared before mounting. Markdown's per-frame owned-block
conversions remain counted separately. Edit operation accounting includes
Harness settling (and any resulting render); a subsequent explicit redraw has
its own allocation counts. Neither is called a storage-only edit measurement.
Requested allocation bytes include full replacement sizes for reallocations,
not net live bytes or peak memory. These new totals are observations, not a
claim that whole-source event snapshots, accessibility publication, or source
ingestion are bounded. The existing 1,500 layout/prepaint/paint and 350 semantic
node ceilings apply to each measured redraw. Soft wrap, long single-line
shaping, background-worker throughput, and total frame latency are not certified
by these cases. Exact offscreen caret queries used to verify scroll displacement
run outside the measured shaping sample.

## What is counted

`Window::frame_stats()` returns the most recently completed `FrameStats` for
that window:

- reactive entity renders;
- element request-layout, prepaint, and paint calls;
- invalidations coalesced into the frame;
- product semantic nodes;
- native platform-view placements; and
- retained element-arena capacity growth when test allocator accounting is
  available.

The performance-check binary alone installs a counting global allocator. It
counts allocation and reallocation calls strictly around the measured redraw;
the libraries and shipping applications keep their normal allocator. Every
fixture carries its own allocation ceiling in the serialized report so later
work can lower the relevant ratchet when it removes render-path allocation.
The initial ceilings are the repeatable third-frame value plus 10%, rounded up;
zero remains a strict zero.

`gpui-box-kit-testkit` adds `PerformanceBudget`, named typed limits, and a
serializable `PerformanceReport`. Component fixtures also report mounted rows
and caller-visible builder calls. An unavailable requested metric is a failure,
not a zero.

Schema 3 also reports `caller_input_conversions` and
`has_row_builder_callback`. CodeView, LogStream and AgentDocument take eager
owned collections, not lazy row callbacks: their builder count is genuinely
zero, **not a proxy for mounted rows**. Fixture strings are prepared before
measurement; each clone/conversion needed to feed those APIs is counted
separately and remains dataset-sized. Their current APIs cannot make total
input preparation viewport-bounded. The fixed mount/layout/prepaint/paint and
semantic ceilings are enforced at both dataset sizes; heap ceilings still
include collection conversion and component work. This proves bounded visible
work at the tested sizes, not constant-time ingestion of arbitrary datasets.

The counters are per window. Drawing another window cannot reset or contribute
to them. Shipping builds pay fixed integer increments only; retained allocator
growth is compiled only for tests and explicit test-support builds.

## Timing

Structural counts are the authority wherever they describe the cost. They are
portable across Metal, WARP, Linux software rendering, and browser builds and
do not become looser because a CI machine is slower.

Text shaping, rasterization, and end-to-end renderer submission still need
timing measurements. Acceptance requires Criterion warmup and medians, a same-process
calibration workload, and a documented noise margin. A raw millisecond
threshold from one runner is never accepted as a cross-platform budget. This
renderer-calibration lane is reported separately from the structural gate so a
timing regression cannot be hidden by changing a structural limit, or vice
versa.

`.github/workflows/performance-timing.yml` runs the existing
`gpui-box-wgpu` **CPU shaping** workloads on manual dispatch, with required
`baseline_ref` input. It now blocks that dispatched job on a confident
calibrated regression or invalid/missing evidence. It runs on no push or
schedule. Structural and heap-allocation budgets remain a separate root gate;
the root gate also tests the timing comparator, but does not run noisy timing.

### Calibrated shaping acceptance

From a clean, committed, non-shallow checkout with dependencies cached:

```bash
python3 -B tools/performance-check/timing.py compare \
  --baseline-ref <reviewed-commit> --output target/timing/review
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools/performance-check/tests -v
```

The output directory must be new. There is no implicit previous baseline and
no checked-in machine-speed reference. The operator chooses a reviewed source
revision; the report resolves it and the candidate (default `HEAD`) to exact
commits. Both are measured on the same host in this execution. To exercise the
unchanged control, explicitly pass `--baseline-ref HEAD`.

The runner extracts both revisions with `git archive` into temporary source
directories, then installs the **candidate's identical benchmark and embedded
Lilex/IBM Plex font bytes into both archives**. Library code and lockfiles stay
revision-specific; the workload is the common candidate harness, not the old
revision's benchmark definition. An incompatible baseline API/build or
Criterion package is refused, never silently replaced with the candidate.
Both builds use the current toolchain and the same optimized bench profile.
Sources are removed even on failure; separate reusable build caches remain in
`target/timing-build/{baseline,candidate}`. Builds are locked and offline: CI
explicitly fetches candidate dependencies first; baseline-only dependencies
must already be cached or the run fails closed. The runner never fetches refs
or modifies the checkout. Fetch/unshallow and dependency preparation are
explicit operator actions before measuring.

Each fresh benchmark process runs deterministic black-box integer arithmetic
independent of GPUI, followed by the three existing CosmicText `layout_line`
workloads: no fallback, ASCII with fallback, and mixed-direction paragraphs.
No system fonts are loaded. Each workload and calibration receives 0.5 seconds
warmup, 1 second target measurement, 30 Criterion samples, and a bootstrapped
95% median confidence interval (100,000 resamples). Both builds complete before
sampling. Three unchanged baseline processes run first, then three candidate
processes; `--repeats N` may increase, but never decrease, that minimum.

For workload median interval `[L, U]`, median `M`, and same-process calibration
`[cL, cU]`, median `cM`, the normalized interval is `[L/cU, U/cL]` and point is
`M/cM`. Uniform CPU speed changes normalize away. This is conservative interval
arithmetic, **not a claim of joint 95% coverage** or calibration of GPU work.
For each workload, let `d` be the maximum minus minimum normalized baseline
median across unchanged repeats. Its acceptance envelope is the hull of all
baseline normalized intervals expanded by `d` on each side (lower bound clamped
to zero). Thus the margin is measured baseline noise, not an arbitrary percent
or absolute-millisecond threshold; candidate noise cannot widen the baseline.

- `regression`: every candidate interval is wholly above the envelope; fails.
- `improvement`: every candidate interval is wholly below the envelope.
- `within_noise`: all candidate intervals fit inside the envelope.
- `inconclusive`: all other cases, including overlaps and inconsistent repeats.

The last three do not fail timing acceptance, but **neither within-noise nor
inconclusive proves equivalence**. Three baseline repeats are a small empirical
noise estimate, not a bound on future drift; a noisy host can hide real changes.
Review intervals and repeat on a quiet host when inconclusive. Sequential CPU
calibration does not cancel workload-specific scheduling, thermal or frequency
effects. No sensitivity to small regressions is promised. Missing calibration,
workloads, nonfinite/nonpositive values, inconsistent corpus/session/config,
malformed intervals, or inadequate samples/repeats fail rather than pass.

`report.json` records source commits, exact benchmark and font SHA-256 hashes,
runner hash, lockfile hashes, toolchain/profile, host CPU/OS and CPU-only backend,
raw median confidence intervals, normalized intervals, measured noise margins,
envelopes and verdicts. Raw Criterion samples and process logs accompany it;
CI uploads evidence even after failure. Synthetic tests prove uniform-speed
normalization, true 2x slowdown rejection, noisy overlap handling and invalid
data rejection; they are not measured baselines.

**Unsupported timing coverage:** rasterization, renderer submission, GPU
execution, Metal/WARP timing, browser frame latency and compositor/display
presentation. These need their own workload and calibration designs. This CPU
shaping lane does not close those renderer-latency gaps or replace native visual
and structural validation.

For live diagnostics, `FrameTimingMonitor` holds a reference-counted frame
trace lease, filters observations to one `WindowId`, and retains a caller-sized
history. It observes only newly drawn frames that reached synchronous platform
submission. Its `FrameTimingSummary` derives rate from actual submission-end
timestamps, keeps mean and P95 draw duration, draw-budget overage,
invalidations, and dirty-to-draw latency, and adds submission-call,
dirty-to-submit, first-input-to-submit, and coalesced top-level-input
measurements. “Over budget” still describes time spent in `Window::draw`.
“Submitted” means the platform draw call returned; neither metric claims that
the compositor or display presented or dropped a frame.

The monitor never requests a redraw. A host decides when to poll it and whether
the application workload should produce another frame. Multiple monitors,
benchmarks, and a manual `set_frame_trace_enabled` owner can coexist: dropping
one lease cannot disable another owner or clear its active trace.
