# Coverage

What a general-purpose desktop UI library is expected to provide, what this
one provides, and what is deliberately out of scope. GPUI Box is the
application substrate: if a downstream desktop or browser-hosted product
needs a surface to exist, the surface belongs here unless it is a host
fact, a locale fact, a transport, or a platform chrome the OS already
owns. `crates/docs/components.md` describes the components themselves; this file
exists so a gap is a recorded decision rather than an oversight.

Glass optics use a shared height field, Snell refraction, spectral indices and
Fresnel reflection in all three shader backends. `glass-optics` isolates these
parameters over a ruled fixture, including fused panes. Regular Liquid uses a
lighter Gaussian than Frost so refraction remains legible; Clear and Lens stay
sharp by default. Material silhouettes use the same one-device-pixel SDF
coverage convention on Metal, Direct3D and WGPU, restoring partial pixels from
the exact sharp snapshot under replacement compositing. The implementation is
single-interface screen-space optics, not full volume transport: no second
interface, internal bounces, caustics, hidden-background recovery or real
environment reflection is claimed. Scattering remains spatially uniform;
background-busyness probes and fused-outline shadows remain deferred. See
`crates/docs/compatibility.md` for the material contract and platform evidence boundary.

A component counts as covered only when it has all four of: a public builder or
view, a scene in `gpui_kit::scenes`, behaviour tests driven through simulated
input, and an entry in `crates/docs/components.md`.

## Covered

The isolated JS host does not grant external-file or pasted-image read access
from `ExternalPaths` or paste events. These require an explicit refusal, not
host paths or apparently readable references. A future host capability must
define consent, mount/revision scope, read-only operations, expiry/revocation,
size limits, path privacy, and negative tests. Internal `DragItem` events are
data-only identity/label/kind/built-in-icon values, not file capabilities.

`Tooltipped` is an extension trait rather than a component: it attaches a
`Tooltip` to any element, and is covered wherever that `Tooltip` is.

`PasswordInput` and `OneTimeCodeInput` cover only product-neutral sensitive
entry. The `auth-sign-in` and `auth-verification` scenes show password,
one-time verification, passkey, organization sign-on, and recovery actions as
composition from generic primitives. Account models, provider policy,
credential storage, validation, networking, RPC, and authentication outcomes
remain with the caller.

`BrowserPanel` is listed with a qualification because it is one. It is the
chrome and the states around an embedded web view and it renders no web
content: that needs an engine, and a component library that pulled one into
every binary would be charging every host for a feature almost none of them
use. The host supplies the engine and the surface. What the panel does own is
the part hosts otherwise each get wrong — a build with no engine says so
instead of drawing a blank page, and Loading, Empty, Unavailable, Error, and
Ready remain five distinct answers.

`NodeGraph` places nothing. The caller positions every node, because where a
step belongs is a claim about the run rather than a fact about the component,
and a layout algorithm here would make that claim for every host at once. A
node may carry a caller-rendered thumbnail, whose pixels the graph neither
fetches nor decodes. `GraphInteraction::Inspect` permits only pan, zoom, and
selection proposals; `Arrange` additionally permits movement; `Edit` adds
deletion, connection, and disconnection. The caller remains authoritative for
the selection, topology, positions, and viewport shown on the next frame.

`CinematicEffect` is covered without making an animation runtime mandatory.
The `cinematic-effects` scene stages a resolved deterministic sample, explicit
runtime and invalid-archive fallbacks, and a reduced-motion poster. Component
tests drive exact sampling, frame ownership, RTL mirroring, typed semantics,
and diagnostic redaction. The optional pure-Rust adapter is separately tested
against archive and animation limits under `--all-features`; a default build
retains identical recipes and always-available particle fallback behavior.

## Systems, which span more than one component

A system is not a component. It has no builder of its own to place on a
screen; it is a contract several families implement, so it is covered when the
contract is documented, staged in a scene, and driven through simulated input
against every surface that implements it.

| System | Contract | Implemented by |
|---|---|---|
| Drag and drop (`gpui_kit::interaction::dnd`) | `crates/docs/interaction.md` | `List`, `Tree`, `Tabs`, `Dropzone`, `DataGrid` (column headers), `Dock`/`DockTree` (panel headers, groups, split edges) |

Drag and drop is covered: the contract is written down, the scenes `drag-list`,
`drag-tree`, and `dropzone` stage it, and `crates/gpui-kit/tests/it/dnd.rs`
drives a simulated pointer through every surface above. `DataGrid` reorders its
column headers through the same system, driven in
`crates/gpui-kit/tests/it/grid.rs`, and `Dock` moves panels between regions
through it, driven in `crates/gpui-kit/tests/it/shell.rs`; `DockTree`
additionally reports centre merges into preserved empty stacks and four-way
recursive split placement, driven in `crates/gpui-kit/tests/it/dock_tree.rs`.

## One resize implementation

`SplitPane` is two panes and a divider; `SplitTree` is however many of those the
caller nests; `Dock` builds a `SplitLayout` from the regions that hold panels
and hands it to a `SplitTree`; `DockTree` projects the caller's recursive
`DockTopology` to that same layout. So every dock divider is the same divider a
plain split gives, with the same minimums and published travel range, and there
is one place where dragging a divider is implemented. Every dock stack header
is a `Tabs` strip for the same reason: dragging a panel is the drag system, not
a second one.

The Longbridge GPUI Kit 0.6 dock was reviewed here rather than copied. Its
`PaneTree`, normalization reducer, panel entities, registry, and reconciliation
cache solve ownership inside a retained `DockArea`; importing them would create
a second layout authority and make an action mutate state the Box contract says
the caller owns. `DockTree` therefore keeps its controlled record-and-intent
boundary. Its tests pin the corresponding invariants: load/dump/load reaches a
fixpoint while empty stacks persist, every malformed record shape is refused,
selection and collapse do not move unrelated ratios, a nested divider names
only its own split, one completed drop emits one move intent, and ratios remain
dimensionless when the container changes size. The host still applies and
normalizes accepted structural changes.

## Table or DataGrid

Both are covered and neither replaces the other. `Table` takes materialized
rows and lays all of them out; `DataGrid` takes a render closure and lays out
only the rows the viewport holds, which is what buys it column resizing and
reordering, a pinned group, selection over an incompletely loaded set, opened
rows, and cell editing. `crates/docs/components.md` has the guidance on which to
reach for. A wide `DataGrid` uses one horizontal viewport for its header,
virtualized body, and summary, while a pinned leading group remains frozen at
the reading edge. Its remaining fit-to-content limit is stated rather than
faked: a double click on a column edge reports the request and lets the host
answer.

`TreeGrid` reuses that virtualized machinery for a caller-flattened hierarchy.
Its `tree-grid` scene and `crates/gpui-kit/tests/it/tree_grid.rs` cover bounded
materialization, TreeGrid/Row/GridCell semantics, row hierarchy metadata, and
logical disclosure/parent keyboard intents. It deliberately adds no second
flattening or cross-tree layout system; horizontal scrolling and a frozen
hierarchy column are inherited from `DataGrid` rather than reimplemented.

## Helpers, which the four-part rule does not reach

`field_shell` and `FieldState` draw the one border, background, and focus
treatment every editable control wears. `FocusTrap` keeps the keyboard inside
an open overlay. Neither renders on its own, so neither has a scene of its
own; both are exercised through every control and overlay that uses them.

## Out of scope, and why

- **The calendar itself.** `Calendar`, `DateInput`, `RangePicker`, and
  `TimeInput` are covered; the calendar system, the time-zone database, the
  locale, and the notion of today underneath them are not, and never will be.
  Correctness there is calendar, time-zone and locale work, not UI work, and a
  library that shipped a half-correct calendar would be worse than one that
  shipped none. So the components own no date arithmetic at all and read every
  fact from a host-implemented `DateAdapter`; `crates/docs/datetime.md` is the
  contract. The reference calendar the scenes and tests run on is behind the
  `fixtures` feature, off by default, so it cannot be mistaken for a default.
- **Time formatting.** `Timeline` displays times and day headings, and
  formats neither: it takes strings the host has already put into words. The
  same reasoning that keeps the calendar out of this crate keeps
  “two minutes ago” out of it, and the seam is the adapter above the
  component.
- **Judging or applying a keybinding.** `KeybindingRecorder` captures a
  keystroke and `KeymapEditor` coordinates it with caller-owned command and
  binding identities. Whether it clashes with something, what provenance it
  has, and whether add, remove, or reset should be accepted needs the keymap,
  which the host owns. Both components render the caller's answer rather than
  inventing or persisting one.
- **Persisting a layout.** `SplitLayout` converts to and from plain records so
  a host can write it out, and this crate takes no serialization dependency to
  do it for them.
- **Language intelligence and document policy.** `Editor` fixes the shared
  `TextArea` buffer and geometry to a no-wrap source projection, then accepts
  revision-tagged caller highlights and one synchronous caller-owned
  indentation replacement. `RichTextEditor` projects the same editing
  invariants through styled blocks, alignment, lists, diagnostics, semantics,
  and a formatting toolbar. Grammar/LSP facts, folding and multi-caret policy,
  persistence, collaboration, URL policy, and conversion to a product
  document format remain host work. Syntax colouring still stops at four
  built-in classes on the eight languages `content::highlight` knows. A host
  that has a grammar installs its own spans, and those facts win.
- **Doing what a document says.** `Markdown` draws HTML as the characters
  somebody wrote, reports a link rather than opening it, and names an image
  rather than fetching it. There is no HTML renderer here, no URL policy, and
  no network; `crates/docs/content.md` states why each of those is a refusal rather
  than a gap, and what a host has to supply instead.
- **Delivering a message.** `MessageList` renders five delivery states and
  reports a retry. Sending anything, deciding what a resend means, and knowing
  whether a message was really read are the transport's, and this crate has no
  transport.
- **Capturing a voice or advancing dialogue.** `VoiceReactive` maps a finite
  normalized host sample to a complete meter and `PersonaDialogue` owns the
  portrait, safe Markdown, streaming, and choice composition. Microphone
  access, recognition, synthesis, playback, expression inference, and choosing
  or applying the next turn remain host facts and capabilities.
- **Running a game or deciding an outcome.** `PartyRoster`, `ObjectiveTracker`,
  `AbilityBar`, and `RewardReveal` own reusable character/game presentation,
  malformed-topology refusal, typed intents, RTL, reduced motion, semantics,
  and policy-resolved effects. Combat formulas, cooldown clocks, input maps,
  objective progression, reward eligibility, inventory mutation, persistence,
  networking, and asset fetching remain authoritative host systems. The UI
  never converts a click into a successful action or an item into an owned one.
- **Fetching or decoding an image.** `ImageViewer` frames, zooms and pans an
  element the host hands it, and names the source when the host hands it
  nothing. There is no network here and no decoder, so the pixel size of a
  source is a caller input like every other fact this library cannot hold;
  a viewer given none says the size is unknown rather than reporting the box
  it drew.
- **Media policy.** `TransportBar` reports play, pause, seek, volume, mute,
  speed and a track step, and applies none of them. `AudioPlayer` and
  `VideoPlayer` ask a `MediaTransport`; `PlatformMediaTransport` currently
  implements it with AVFoundation on macOS and Media Foundation on Windows.
  Linux GStreamer and Web HTML media adapters are planned work in
  `crates/docs/foundation-roadmap.md`, not permanent no-backend policy. Playlist and
  queue ownership, URL/auth policy, DRM, subtitle/track policy, output-device
  policy, custom cache/retry and capture remain host responsibilities.
- **Reading a 3D model that is not glTF.** `ModelViewer` reads the subset of
  glTF 2.0 stated in `crates/docs/components.md` and refuses everything else, without
  a scene-graph dependency, a material system, or a texture pipeline. Other
  formats, materials, animation and skinning are not gaps to be filled here:
  a document that needs them is one an application converts before it arrives.
- **Inventing a scale, a locale, or a series policy.** A chart still does not
  own data. Axes, ticks, domains, stacking, aggregation, and "2 minutes ago"
  are facts the host already has or can compute; Box paints them. Line and bar
  geometry now enters, updates, and exits by caller business id; area fill,
  exact-text crosshair tooltips, keyboard traversal, and stale-data retention
  are component behavior rather than downstream drawing work. The old Kit-era
  refusal of charts themselves is lifted: line, bar, area, and distribution
  surfaces are in scope as application primitives. A
  business-intelligence toolkit — live query, crossfilter, annotation
  layers, financial overlays — is still a product, not a substrate.
- **Owning a platform picker.** Colour, file, and print dialogs that replace
  the operating system stay out. In-window colour wells, dropzones, and
  print-preview chrome that report a choice are in scope; they do not
  become the system dialog.
- **Menu bar and window chrome.** Owned by the platform window, not by a
  component tree.
- **Product-specific marketing policy.** `Carousel`, `Rating`, and `Bubble`
  are now neutral, caller-owned primitives. Product-specific autoplay,
  recommendation, delivery, and conversation policy remains outside the Kit.

## Framework and platform limitations

The component coverage review above has no remaining MUI or shadcn component
gap. The limitations below are intentionally kept separate: they are
framework, renderer, platform, or host-policy boundaries, not missing public
components. Out of scope above means "will not be built, and here is why";
these entries record capabilities that need a framework or platform owner
without pretending that a component-local workaround is complete support.

### Backdrop work regions preserve the established pixels, 2026-09-04

The WGPU `frost` and `glass` scenes were captured with Linux llvmpipe
immediately before and after bounding their snapshot, blur, and composite
passes. All four PNGs are byte-identical (`AE = 0`):

| Image | SHA-256 before and after |
|---|---|
| `frost-studio-dark.png` | `fd936b094521bc9fe91149f7fc6a0365fddd63554ebf13fe328c07d295ab1ec9` |
| `frost-studio-light.png` | `11dd9814eddb4097c675f2c793b530017eeb59b8dc08620a52587b84aa743418` |
| `glass-studio-dark.png` | `37387fe70f5a9a5f0e86908bf968867cea9d0513c18966df36d6cae02d686ad8` |
| `glass-studio-light.png` | `604cdf8137acedb1fbb2dece495189f5310e7025273e37fa95a183a344a23ff1` |

The shared region calculation retains every Gaussian dependency, the maximum
refracted and dispersed reach, and requested probe samples while leaving
texture coordinates and material math unchanged. Direct3D's all-feature crate
also cross-compiles for `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`. Metal cannot run in the Linux
orb; its check is the dispatched `Platforms` workflow. This is a pixel-equivalent renderer
optimization, so no macOS or Windows baseline is recaptured or changed; their
existing headless checks remain the acceptance authority.

### Regular glass text contrast

Kit constrains the Regular material's shader wash to maintain the WCAG 4.5:1
normal-text ratio against the opposing neutral backdrop, including transmission
gain and optical lift. This applies before any probe response as well: a mean
luminance cannot guarantee contrast at every text position. It does not add an
opaque or source-over face, change large-panel appearance, or affect Clear.
Caller-supplied text colours and optical overrides still require caller review.
`Glass::protect_text_contrast(false)` and the matching group option explicitly
retain the material's wash instead; the caller then owns foreground legibility.
This is used for native material calibration, not enabled silently on existing
reading surfaces. Explicit tints compose into the RGB material wash (including
fused bridges) before its rim light, rather than disappearing behind a zero-alpha
fill or being converted to an achromatic pole by framework sanitization.

`tools/liquid-glass-reference` records native SwiftUI references and validates
GPUI candidates with independent colour, rim, bridge and held-out-size scores.
The persistent menu producer now resizes its real layout at simulated times,
records measured geometry, and rejects unchanged menu pixels claiming a resize.
This does not reproduce SwiftUI content crossfades or prove native dynamics.
Foreground press scaling uses paired framework transforms without reflow;
the material outline stays fixed, and reduced motion suppresses the scale.
The 1.014 default is Kit policy informed by one native label specimen, not a
universal native constant. Rounded foreground clipping and explicit window-overlay
mask escape are implemented. Calibration trials are not accepted catalog
baselines or proof of Apple's private implementation.

Application-wide Reduce transparency belongs in `ThemeRegistry`, alongside
density: call `set_reduce_transparency(reduce, cx)` to update it and repaint all
windows. `ThemeRegistry::set_reduce_transparency` and `reduce_transparency`
provide the direct setter/getter. Activation, density changes, registration and
counterpart resolution preserve this preference; an unchanged value does not
rebuild the resolved theme. Scoped `Theme::with_reduce_transparency` remains
available for individual exhibits; no root `ThemeOverlay` workaround is needed.

### Rounded glass profile reach, 2026-09-08

The menu's 12 px corner and requested 36 px bevel exposed a second optical
singularity, distinct from finite-difference medial-axis normals: the analytic
arc normal still had nonzero dome slope when its parallel curve collapsed at
the arc centre. Both Metal and Linux WGPU showed the resulting pointed highlight.
`BackdropGlass::optical_bevel` now bounds the complete optical profile by positive
corner radii and lobe half-extents before all three renderers pack it. The same
depth across a union prevents seams; specular strength, hairline, wash and blur
are unchanged. Square corners retain their intentional incident-face crease.
CPU and native pixel regressions include the menu radius and sample both before
and after the arc centre, while requiring a real rim highlight to remain.

### Clear media reading

Clear is an appearance-independent on-media material: its subtree inherits
`color.onMediaForeground` and `color.onMediaHairline`, never an adaptive flip.
Reduced transparency keeps that light content on dark Frosted
`color.onMediaBackground`, including in light themes. `dimmed(true)` applies
the `effect.glassDimming` 35% backing only to Clear, and retains it when reduced;
all other presets ignore dimming. This policy is inside Glass/GlassGroup, not a
caller-installed theme override. Deliberately coloured child elements still
own their explicit colours, as on other surfaces.

The current glass integration has Linux offscreen and native Metal evidence.
Windows/WARP is unverified for this revision: no Windows runner was available;
the existing Windows baseline is not claimed as acceptance of these changes.

### Downsampled backdrop blur deliberately deferred, 2026-09-04

Metal, Direct3D, and WGPU keep full-resolution backdrop textures and preserve
the established Gaussian and refraction samples while clipping work to the
surface's conservative sampling region. Rendering the blur through a smaller
intermediate texture could reduce bandwidth further, but resampling changes
the material's pixels and may change the apparent radius, rim detail, and
paint-order boundaries. It is therefore not hidden behind a renderer-local
shortcut. A future downsampled path needs one shared quality contract, focused
renderer tests, and reviewed replacement captures from both active baseline
renderers (Metal on macOS and WARP on Windows).

### Metal and WARP baselines outstanding for this wave, 2026-09-03

Three light-appearance fixes landed from a Linux orb, which can run neither
active renderer. Twenty-two images across eleven scenes are therefore stale on
macOS and Windows until someone captures them there:

| Change | Scenes, in both Studio themes |
|---|---|
| Sprite corner coverage | `visual-effects`, `cinematic-effects`, `game-ui` |
| Washed panel surface | `failure-panel`, `outcome-panel`, `state-ladder`, `kanban`, `heatmap`, `audio-waveform`, `node-graph` |
| Scrolling menu edge fade | `form` |

Every claim recorded for them is a Linux llvmpipe claim and says so. The
renderers were compared with a full catalog capture taken immediately before
each change and re-checked after it, so the counts above are what those changes
moved and not accumulated drift; `snapshots/headless/linux` itself stays as it
was, retired and stale, rather than being refreshed for three scenes and left
alone for the rest.

Nothing here asserts what Metal or WARP drew before the change or draws after
it. Whoever captures on those platforms reviews the images against the entries
below rather than accepting them unseen.

### Sprite corner coverage reviewed on a retired renderer, 2026-09-03

The polychrome sprite corner mask's dependence on `fwidth(distance)` was found
downstream in a light appearance and reproduced here in direct offscreen
readback under Linux llvmpipe — no compositor took part, so it is a renderer
defect rather than a capture artifact. `visual-effects` and `cinematic-effects`
carried the dashed seam through their own sprite batches and particle recipes,
and `game-ui` through its item art; the three scenes are the whole of the
catalog's polychrome sprite coverage, and all six of their images move with the
correction.

Whether Metal and WARP ever showed the same seam is not recorded, because
neither renderer can be run here. Both carried the identical `fwidth`-sized
mask, so both were exposed to the same class of failure; the correction removes
the derivative rather than compensating for one backend, and reproduces the
width a conforming `fwidth` reports. Whoever next captures on macOS and Windows
should review those six images against this entry rather than accepting them
unseen.

### An overflowing menu with no active baseline, 2026-09-03

No catalog scene fills a menu past its own height. `command-palette`,
`choice`, `multi-select`, `cascader`, and `mention-input` each stage a list
that fits, which is why the boundary treatment every one of those menus lacked
— a row sliced through its glyphs at the viewport edge, with the card's
rounded corner cutting across the same row — was never in a reviewed picture.

A temporary llvmpipe exhibit rendered a `CommandPalette` holding fifteen
commands in three sections at the same 480-pixel width and `menuMaxHeight` the
scene uses, in both Studio themes, before and after the fade. Before, the
eighth row was cut horizontally through its cap height with its shortcut chips
halved; after, that row fades out over the band and the boundary reads as
"there is more below". The exhibit was then removed, because Linux's baseline
set is retired and cannot author the active Metal and WARP images.

Behavior coverage keeps the permanent invariant: `overlay::popover`'s edge
decision fades an end only while it hides a row, fades neither end for a list
that fits, and does not mistake a sub-pixel resting offset for travel.

Two gaps stay open for whoever next captures on macOS and Windows. The first
is the exhibit: a palette long enough to overflow belongs in the
`command-palette` family so the boundary has a picture. The second is that
`CommandPalette` still does not scroll its keyboard highlight into view the
way `Select` and `Combobox` do, so arrowing past the fold moves a highlight
nobody can see; the fade now says the rows are there, and the reveal is the
separate change that lets the keyboard reach them.

### Edge-faded crossing surfaces with no active baseline, 2026-09-03

A tall `SettingsSection` whose card crossed the bottom of a `ScrollArea` was
rendered before and after the primitive-aware edge-fade correction in a
temporary `scroll-fade` exhibit. Both Studio themes were inspected with Linux
llvmpipe: before the correction the card shadow was absent while its visible
rows remained; afterwards the shadow retained the card's visible grouping and
the fill continued to fade over the band. The temporary exhibit was then
removed because Linux's baseline set is retired and cannot author the active
Metal and WARP images.

Framework behavior coverage keeps the permanent invariant: a shadow and a
filled path taller than the band remain non-transparent when they cross the
region edge, the path carries a transparent-to-opaque shader gradient, and a
primitive smaller than the band retains nearest-edge alpha. Whoever next
captures on macOS and Windows should add the crossing `SettingsSection` state
to the `scroll-fade` family and review both active renderer images rather than
accepting either unseen.

### Three opt-in states with no active baseline, 2026-09-03

An `InlineEdit` reading a long multi-line value, a `NodeGraph` that keeps its
dot grid but refuses the origin axes, and neutral controls declaring an
overlay ground now have complete layout or paint behavior but no permanent
catalog state. Existing scenes intentionally keep their defaults, so their
Metal and WARP pixels do not move; Linux's llvmpipe baseline set is retired
and cannot author either active renderer's new images.

The reading layout is covered by measured bounds, including the pen remaining
inside a bounded single-line row. The graph's default-on axes and independent
grid/ground settings are covered by behavior. Overlay-grounded Secondary,
Default, refused, icon, and toggle paths share one resolver whose composited
resting fill clears the 2 L* surface floor in both bundled themes, while the
implicit panel ground resolves to the historical `raised`/`active` paints.
A temporary llvmpipe exhibit put a Secondary button, an unpressed Toggle, and
a Secondary IconButton on `OverlaySurface::FLOATING`; resting and hovered
captures in both Studio themes were reviewed before the exhibit was removed.

Whoever next captures on macOS and Windows should add a long multi-line
reading value to `inline-edit`, an axes-free state to `node-graph`, and the
three grounded controls to the overlay or button family, then review both
active renderer images rather than accepting them unseen.

### Two colour settings with no scene of their own, 2026-09-02

`TabItem::tint` and `NodeGraph::ground_light` change what a strip and a canvas
look like, and neither is drawn by any scene in the catalog. That is a
deliberate deferral, not an oversight, and it is a renderer boundary rather
than a component one: an active visual baseline can only be captured on a
machine with that renderer, and the two active sets are Metal on macOS and
WARP on Windows. A scene added without both is a `headless check` that fails
for missing baselines on the two platforms that gate a release, so the picture
would be added by breaking the thing that reviews pictures.

Both are covered by behaviour: a tinted strip publishes the same tree as an
untinted one down to the measured bounds, a refused ground paints no gradient
at all, and a canvas that has not asked is still lit. What is not covered is
what they look like. Whoever next captures baselines on macOS and Windows
should add a tinted strip beside the untinted one in the navigation family and
a flat ground to the canvas family, and review the images rather than accept
them.

### Fit clearance with no scene of its own, 2026-09-02

`NodeGraph::fit_clearance` reserves caller-owned canvas edge bands when the
graph frames its measured world. No gallery state was added from Linux: the
active visual baselines are Metal on macOS and WARP on Windows, and adding a
state without captures from both would leave the release gate incomplete.

The framing arithmetic instead covers zero, asymmetric, composed and
oversized clearances, and a mounted graph with clearance publishes the same
semantic tree as one without it. Whoever next captures baselines on macOS and
Windows should add a fit-clearance state to the canvas family and review both
active images.

### Shared presentation tiers and semantic token authority, 2026-08-27

`Theme::variant_colors` resolves the seven shared tiers (`Filled`, `Light`,
`Outline`, `Subtle`, `Default`, `Transparent`, `White`) against a palette
group, a semantic role, or an explicit paint, and `Button`, `IconButton`,
`Badge`, and `Tag` accept `.variant(..)` / `.color(..)` on top of their
existing vocabularies without moving a pixel of the defaults. Other coloured
surfaces — `Callout`, `Banner`, `StatusDot`, `StatusLine`, `ProgressBar`, and
`ProgressCircle` — use the same semantic theme roles through their own
state-oriented APIs. They intentionally do not expose arbitrary per-instance
variant colours: tone is a fact, while variant tiers are a reusable choice for
surfaces such as buttons, badges, and tags. This keeps all actual paint values
in the theme token authority without creating a second override vocabulary.

### A product backdrop that the bundled ramp still cannot 1:1, 2026-08-18

`Surface::Backdrop` and multi-layer elevation close the two kit-side holes a
downstream prototype hit: there is now a plane darker than `canvas` for a
card to sit on, and an elevation step can carry both a contact shadow and a
wide one. The bundled Studio themes take the new roles without retuning the
five existing surfaces, so the gallery does not move.

What is still not 1:1 is the light appearance. The prototype paints the page
`#c9c9d1`, the well `#dcdce2`, and the card `#ffffff`. A white `panel`
leaves `raised` nowhere to go — it would need L\* ≥ 103, which is outside
the colour space — and dropping the page to `#c9c9d1` forces `sunken`
darker still, at which point the light text and semantic rungs (tuned for a
shallow well) fail the contrast floor in eleven pairs. Retuning that light
foreground and semantic scale is a separate change; this one does not do
it. The library still groups with colour rather than with a line, and a
card still does not draw a border: lines stay reserved for focus, invalid,
and drop.

### Typography and visual polish audit, 2026-08-11

Before changing typography, eight independent reviewers inspected all 98 Linux
headless scenes in both Studio themes: 196 images, each 1840×2000. Every image
was checked for (1) type hierarchy and accidental GPUI-default text, (2) line
height and icon/chip baselines, (3) token spacing rhythm, (4) dark-theme
contrast, (5) visibly distinct Loading, Empty, Unavailable, Error, and Ready
states, and (6) clipping, overflow, and unconstrained full-width content. This
is the named pre-change inventory; `clean` means no defect was visible under
that rubric, not that every possible interaction was exercised.

| Scenes | Pre-change finding |
|---|---|
| `accordion` | Medium: disabled title and detail are too faint in both themes. |
| `actions` | High: dark toolbar icons, shortcuts, menu outline, and separators nearly disappear. |
| `agent-roster` | Clean. |
| `agent-run-canvas` | Clean. |
| `anchor-list` | Medium: dark explanatory copy is nearly invisible. |
| `animated-number`, `aspect-ratio` | Clean. |
| `approval` | Medium: dark secondary action is weak; the focus ring and labelled divider need clearance. |
| `audio-player` | High: media-control baselines diverge and inactive rails/separators disappear, especially in dark. |
| `auth-sign-in`, `auth-verification` | Medium: dark banner, placeholder, link, and verification-cell boundaries are too weak. |
| `badge` | Medium: several dark semantic foreground/background pairs are hard to distinguish. |
| `breadcrumb` | Low: the light-theme slash sits above the text baseline. |
| `browser-panel` | Medium: the five states are distinct, but long Ready content is hard-clipped. |
| `button` | Medium: control sizes rely on boxes more than a coherent type ladder; dark disabled labels are weak. |
| `calendar` | Medium: dark adjacent/disabled dates and navigation are too faint; fixture explanation uses default-sized text. |
| `card` | Medium: a two-line card stretches across nearly the full canvas. |
| `cascader` | High: an unconstrained trigger and narrow popup disagree; dark disabled rows disappear. |
| `choice` | High: dark unchecked and disabled controls are almost invisible. |
| `code-view` | Medium: an intentionally long line clips without an equally visible horizontal-scroll affordance in both themes. |
| `collapsible` | High: the dark managed section is nearly invisible. |
| `command-palette` | Medium: dark section labels, secondary commands, and keycaps are too faint. |
| `content` | High: the states are truthful, but dark pinned/filter/empty affordances and progress rails disappear. |
| `context-menu` | Medium: fixture copy falls back to large default text; dark metadata is weak. |
| `conversation` | High: duplicated long message groups and an unconstrained reading column obscure the intended scroll states. |
| `copy-button` | Low: success is repeated as adjacent `Copied` labels. |
| `cost-meter` | High: dark labels, refusal reasons, and unknown values are nearly invisible. |
| `data-grid` | Medium: chip baselines and compact type are inconsistent. Dark row hover/selected are now separate washes; managed rows no longer fade the whole row. |
| `data-grid-editing` | Medium: editor and cell baselines differ and the focus edge collides with a grid line. |
| `date-range` | Medium: disabled/range dates lack contrast and adjacent-month dates lack hierarchy. |
| `date-time` | Medium: light separators sit low and error copy touches the field. |
| `detail` | High: labels, unknown/not-applicable values, and dark metadata are too faint. |
| `diagnostics-list` | High: Hint and explanatory text nearly disappear; chip icon baselines diverge. |
| `dialog` | Low: light is clean; only masked background copy is extremely faint in dark. |
| `diff-view` | Low: top clearance and the dark split divider are weak. |
| `document-tabs` | Medium: light helper copy and dark inactive close controls are too faint. |
| `drag-list` | Clean. |
| `drag-tree` | Medium: light is clean; dark status copy nearly disappears and preview content sits high. |
| `drawer` | Medium: light is clean; the dark unchecked box is difficult to find. |
| `dropzone` | Medium: helper copy is too faint and states move vertically when a detail line is absent. |
| `failure-panel` | Medium: top copy clips in light; secondary failure detail is weak and icon/text centring differs. |
| `filter-bar` | Low: light Add-filter/chip baselines differ; dark is clean. |
| `find-replace` | High: dark explanatory copy disappears, controls are over-wide, and count/arrows are crowded. |
| `form` | Medium: the Region popup covers field help; dark unselected text is still faint. Errors now clear the field. |
| `frost` | High: dark frost lacks enough edge/surface evidence; light needs bottom clearance and consistent stripes. The edge evidence a frosted surface is missing is what `glass` carries; `Frost` stays frosted deliberately, being the material every renderer can produce. |
| `glass` | Regular Liquid separates reading surfaces with its 8 px material-owned blur, saturation, achromatic wash, lensing and hairline; Frost retains the stronger 24 px scattering fallback. Rim refraction samples the scattered source; Clear stays sharp and media-only, with light content and optional 35% dimming. The material's own fractional and rounded edge uses a one-device-pixel SDF ramp restored from the sharp snapshot, before inherited clip coverage. Reduced transparency resolves presets and overlays to Frosted. Small non-Clear surfaces may flip appearance through hysteresis; large and unmeasured surfaces keep the window appearance. Ring shadows use the five optical-source samples' mean and variance, retaining the last completed statistics; this is a sampled separation cue, not exhaustive backdrop analysis. Foreground press scale uses paired framework transforms without reflow and is suppressed under reduced motion. Caller content is rounded-clipped; window overlays explicitly escape ancestor masks. Fused-outline shadows still need a generic SDF shadow primitive. Over-budget surfaces/groups use opaque fallbacks. The exhibit covers text/media backdrops, compact controls, non-flipping surfaces and admission/lobe budgets. `scroll-edge-effect` owns the transcript-ramp exhibit. Native renderer evidence is recorded in `compatibility.toml`; ybouane/liquidglass and callstack/liquid-glass informed public material distinctions and edge treatment, but no Apple optical/dynamic equivalence is claimed. |
| `hover-card` | Medium: helper and body copy are too faint, especially in dark. |
| `ide-shell` | High: dark shell height leaves a large void and Empty/Unavailable claims conflict. |
| `image-viewer` | High: metadata and disabled controls are too faint; the third viewer breaks the first two viewers' grid/container rhythm. |
| `inline-edit` | High: dark helper text disappears, errors touch fields, and the short value gets an over-wide editor. |
| `input` | High: read-only/disabled values are made unreadable rather than distinctly unavailable. |
| `json-view` | Low: comment columns and selected-row extent are inconsistent; dark null/comment values are weak. |
| `kbd` | Clean. |
| `keybinding` | Medium: unbound/help/error text is faint and keycap/icon/row baselines vary. |
| `keymap-editor` | High: `Defaults` and host-managed copy use GPUI's large default; chips, conflict/source text, and actions do not share a row grid. |
| `list` | Light is clean; low in dark for title/list clearance and missing continuation affordance. |
| `loading` | Clean. Every indicator paints from the neutral `color.loader.*` roles, the placeholder is held inside a loudness band by the token gate, and each of the six is a different picture rather than a different arrangement of the same one. |
| `log-stream` | Medium: level/inline chips sit off baseline and small status copy is faint. |
| `markdown` | Medium: the dark unfetched state disappears; truncated repetition and embedded-block widths are unclear. |
| `menu` | Low: shortcut gaps/insets vary and the dark section label is weak. |
| `menubar` | Medium: shortcuts, anchors, item gaps, and dividers do not share one baseline/rhythm. |
| `model-viewer` | High: a dark labelled divider crosses its label; metadata and disabled controls are too faint. |
| `motion-flip` | Low: light caption contrast/button padding and dark badge centring need correction. |
| `motion-state` | Medium: progress tracks disappear and the dark segmented strip stretches beyond its content. |
| `node-graph` | High: edges cross labels, loose labels lack anchors, and dark node metadata is too faint. |
| `notification-center` | High: unread markers move between action/close slots and rows without detail collapse. |
| `offering-catalog` | Medium: type badges and source columns are inconsistent; source/banner copy is faint. |
| `overlay` | Low: dark secondary-button separation is weak. |
| `pagination` | High: light previous/first controls look disabled away from the first page. |
| `permission-matrix` | Low: wrapped policy detail breaks row rhythm and dark secondary copy is weak. |
| `popover` | Low: light unchecked-box contrast and optical centring are weak. |
| `progress-circle`, `reading-direction` | Clean. |
| `schema-form` | Medium: dark fields and placeholders disappear; required markers drift off baseline. |
| `scroll-area` | Medium: the final line is cut in half and the light thumb is faint. |
| `scroll-fade` | Clean. |
| `scroll-shadow` | Medium: the first line is cut in half and the dark bottom shadow is weak. |
| `search-field` | Low: light hit-chip outlines are too faint. |
| `server-list` | Low: expanded error spacing is inconsistent and light helper copy is weak. |
| `settings` | Medium: unavailable explanation is made unreadable, especially in dark. |
| `sidebar` | Medium: dark managed and workspace metadata nearly disappear. |
| `sparkline` | Medium: dark minimum/maximum values are too faint. |
| `split-pane`, `split-tree` | High: dark dividers and drag handles nearly disappear. |
| `status` | Medium: two short status messages stretch nearly the full canvas. |
| `table` | Low: the scene now shows ready, a stale refresh, and empty. Managed rows keep their badges; hover and selected are separate washes. |
| `tabs` | Medium: scene body falls back to large default text and dark disabled tab is too faint. |
| `textarea` | High: dark placeholders, disabled text, and field surfaces disappear. |
| `thinking` | Medium: dark secondary/empty copy is weak and short rows stretch full-width. |
| `toast` | Low: bottom clearance and dark close-control contrast are marginal. |
| `toggle` | High: dark disabled and unselected states nearly disappear. |
| `tool-call` | Clean. |
| `toolbar` | Medium: scene body falls back to default text; dark controls/boundaries and group spacing are weak. |
| `tooltip` | Medium: trigger and tooltip have nearly the same visual role and no strong pointing relationship. |
| `transport` | High: dark rails, speeds, status copy, and unknown duration disappear; control baselines and mute forms diverge. |
| `tree` | Medium: dark ignored state is too faint and selected-row extent is ambiguous. |
| `tree-grid` | Medium: dark structure disappears and disclosure/icon columns do not reserve consistent slots. |
| `upload-list` | High: dark queued/refusal explanation disappears; progress/action columns and icon sizes vary. |
| `video-player` | Medium: volume controls do not share a baseline; dark rails/help disappear and the player lacks a balanced width strategy. |
| `wizard` | High: dark step details and Back boundary disappear; horizontal steps lack a shared title baseline. |

This pass does not accept a root-level inherited font as a fix. A component can
be embedded beneath any host text style, so each element that emits text must
choose its own complete `TypeScale` step. The typography gate records that
contract. It also does not turn disabled content invisible, treat a refusal as
empty data, invent a decoder/browser/graph layout, or add application policy to
make a fixture look fuller.

#### What closed the table

The table above stays as the pre-change inventory. What closed most of it was
not per-scene patching but two machine-checked rules in the token layer, each
of which had been failing silently in every theme:

- **Surface separation.** Every nesting step — canvas to panel, panel to card,
  card to raised, and the overlay against what it covers — now has to differ by
  at least three CIE L\* points, in the right direction, or
  `TokenDocument::validate` refuses the theme. The dark neutral ramp was
  respaced and the light one retuned to pass it. That is what made the card,
  table, dock and popup boundaries in dozens of the `High` rows visible;
  `contrast.rs` and `crates/docs/token-model.md` carry the contract.
- **Tone distinction.** `muted`, `faint`, `placeholder` and `disabled` were
  three different facts wearing one grey in dark, and an inverted ladder in
  light, while every foreground/background contrast pair passed. Each rung now
  has to differ by three L\* measured as distance from the canvas, so one rule
  holds in both appearances. That is what made the disabled control, the
  placeholder, the divider and the explanatory line in the remaining `High`
  and `Medium` rows tell themselves apart.

`Card`, `CardHeader` and `StyledExt::card_surface` replaced three incompatible
hand-rolled card shells, which is what closed the surface-rhythm findings in
the agent, game and notification rows.

After recapturing all 216 macOS baselines against the retuned themes, the rows
that still showed a defect were fixed individually:

| Scene | What was left, and what was done |
|---|---|
| `keymap-editor` | `Defaults` was a step larger than its peer `Current bindings`; both are now `Label`. |
| `ide-shell` | The `Problems` panel carried a badge counting three problems and one string that claimed Unavailable and Empty at once. It now makes one claim and counts nothing it cannot list. The shell also fills the scene rather than leaving the lower third empty. |
| `notification-center` | The unread marker sat in the trailing flow, so it landed beside the action on one row and beside the close control on the next. It is now a fixed slot beside the title. |
| `node-graph` | An edge label was drawn six pixels from the midpoint that also carries the disconnect chip, so the two overlapped. The label now clears the chip's radius. |
| `cascader` | The trigger stretched to the scene while its popup kept its own width. The scene now gives the trigger the width of the surface it opens. |

This re-review was one reviewer over the 216 recaptured macOS images, not a
repeat of the eight-reviewer pass, and it read the rows the table had flagged
most closely. Three findings were looked at and deliberately left: a
conversation and a diff still fill the width they are given, because the
reading measure is the caller's; the transport's mute control keeps a different
form when muted, because that difference is the state; and a scrolled popup
still shows a partial row at its clip, because that is what being scrolled
looks like.

### Motion framework boundaries

The primitives in `crates/docs/motion.md` cover a value moving from one state to
another, motion that is interrupted, composed or driven by a gesture, and
springs described as a duration and a bounce. The remaining entries are
renderer/framework boundaries, not missing catalog components.

The spring itself is no longer one of those boundaries: GPUI owns analytic
fixed- and moving-target evolution, velocity-preserving element retargeting,
playback state, projected targets, and finite overshoot. Kit owns the theme and
component policy above it. This is an invisible framework primitive and does
not add a scene merely to increase catalog coverage.

Touch recognition is no longer a local component approximation either.
When a platform supplies raw `TouchEvent`s, GPUI resolves tap/multi-tap, phased
axis-locked pan and frame-rate-independent momentum, prediction correction,
touch-drag, long press, multi-contact pinch, exclusive ID-based pan/pinch
ownership, cancellation and fling interruption through window dispatch.
Tests cover contact reordering/degeneracy, either pinch contact cancelling,
captured ownership across redraw and a centroid crossing another view, and
scroll consumption plus residual handoff/reversal without double movement.
Platform inactivity cancels pending recognition and post-release momentum.
These tests do not execute native devices, native keyboards or system gestures.
Rotation and arbitrary simultaneous recognizer graphs are not provided;
captured owners must cancel before unregistering, and manipulation reversal
does not transfer ownership back to scrolling. Native geometry forwarding
returns unavailable for unsupported queries; its shared tests prove transport
and refusal, not platform text geometry. Platform-generated trackpad pinch
remains a separate input path.

| Framework boundary | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Shape in `flip` | `Flip::shape` interpolates radius, border width, border colour and background over the same spring that carries position and size, and `Shaping::shaped` applies the result, so a row becoming a card travels between the two forms. The caller states both forms and applies what comes back, because `Flipped` wraps an element it did not build and cannot reach the style inside it. What is still not interpolated is anything with no numeric path between the two forms — a shadow set, a gradient, or a change of element kind. |
| Overscroll | `motion::rubber_band` damps a pull past a boundary, but nothing in the library overscrolls: a `ScrollArea` stops dead at its end, so the band is available to a caller and used by no component here. |

### Media capabilities beyond native playback

`PlatformMediaTransport` closes the ordinary macOS/Windows decoder, output,
clock and native-view gap. `MediaCapabilities` now makes audio/video, seek,
volume, rates, native-track and output-selection support explicit at runtime;
unsupported controls are absent or inert. `MediaErrorKind` preserves no-backend,
invalid-source, open, playback and refusal categories through the Kit seam, so
downstream code never parses a platform diagnostic. The remaining media work is additive capability,
not basic playback: playlist/queue ownership; audio, subtitle and accessibility
description track selection; audio output-device switching; DRM; application
cache/retry and authentication policy; picture-in-picture and fullscreen;
recording/capture; frame-accurate extraction plus waveform/thumbnail generation;
and Linux/Web backends. A platform codec refusal remains `no-backend`, while an
unreadable source remains `failed`; neither is converted to empty media.

### Components

The internal inventory is not enough to discover a family that does not exist,
so the component catalog is also compared against a mature external baseline.
The 2026-08-27 primary baseline is the official
[Material UI component overview](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/).
That page lists 59 entries: Inputs (13), Data display (10), Feedback (6),
Surface (4), Navigation (9), Layout (5), Lab (2), and Utils (10). The current
[MUI component index](https://mui.com/components/) also exposes newer entries
such as `Number Field` and `InitColorSchemeScript`; because the two official
indexes are not yet identical, this document records the dated overview rather
than pretending that a component count is a stable quality score.

[MUI X](https://mui.com/x/introduction/) is tracked separately: its current
stable advanced families are Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Charts, and Tree
View. Scheduler is listed as Preview, and advanced Pro/Premium features are
not silently counted as free Core coverage. The mapping compares
product-neutral behavior, not React, DOM, CSS, or API spelling:

The second coverage baseline is [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), whose
official description is a set of accessible components **and a code
distribution platform**. Its current [component catalog](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)
lists 64 first-party entries. That is a valid open-source component coverage
baseline alongside MUI: the source-distribution model changes ownership and
customisation, not whether an input, overlay, data, or layout capability needs
to exist. Community registries remain outside this dated first-party count.
GPUI Box already follows the important part of that model — callers own data
and actions, while the Kit owns reusable visual and interaction contracts — but
those contracts must still be complete and machine-tested like a maintained
library. The count is not added to MUI's count because names and granularity
differ; every entry is instead mapped by behavior below.

| shadcn family | Entries | Strong equivalent | Partial / foundation | Unimplemented |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Interaction and forms | 20 | `Button`, `Button Group`, `Checkbox`, `Combobox`, `Calendar`, `Date Picker`, `Field`, `Input`, `Input OTP`, `Radio Group`, `Select`, `Switch`, `Textarea`, `Toggle`, `Toggle Group`, `Label`, `Slider` | `Input Group`, `Native Select`, `Questionnaire` | — |
| Feedback and surfaces | 20 | `Accordion`, `Alert`, `Aspect Ratio`, `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Bubble`, `Card`, `Carousel`, `Collapsible`, `Dialog`, `Empty`, `Hover Card`, `Message Scroller`, `Progress`, `Sheet`, `Skeleton`, `Toast` | `Alert Dialog`, `Attachment`, `Message` | — |
| Navigation and overlays | 13 | `Breadcrumb`, `Command`, `Context Menu`, `Drawer`, `Dropdown Menu`, `Menubar`, `Pagination`, `Popover`, `Sidebar`, `Tabs`, `Tooltip`, `Kbd` | `Navigation Menu` | — |
| Data, layout, and foundation | 11 | `Chart`, `Data Table`, `Direction`, `Item`, `Separator`, `Table`, `Typography`, `Resizable`, `Scroll Area`, `Spinner` | `Marker` | — |
| **Total** | **64** | **56** | **8** | **—** |

This normalized shadcn mapping is intentionally stricter than a name search.
For example, `Message Scroller` maps to the virtualized `MessageList`,
`Resizable` maps to the shared `SplitPane` divider, and `Direction` maps to the
layout-direction foundation. `Native Select` is only partial because GPUI's
`Select` is a themed popup control. `Input Group` and `Questionnaire` remain
composition patterns whose product-specific policy is intentionally
caller-owned. `Slider` and multiple selection are full behavior matches
through the orientation-aware `Slider` and controlled `MultiSelect` contracts.
`MultiSelect` is an intentional GPUI extension for the multiple-selection use
case; it is listed in the library coverage above and in the completed
capabilities below, but it is not counted as an additional shadcn entry.

| MUI family | Entries | GPUI Box mapping | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Inputs | 13 | `Autocomplete` → `Combobox` (single-answer); `Button`/`Button Group` → `Button`/`ButtonGroup`; `Checkbox` → `Checkbox`; `Radio Group` → caller-composed `Radio`; `Select` → `Select` (single-answer); multiple selection → `MultiSelect`; `Slider` → orientation-aware `Slider`; `Switch` → `Switch`; `Text Field` → `TextInput`/`NumberInput`/`TextArea`; `Toggle Button` → `Toggle`/`ToggleGroup` | Broad coverage; Floating Action Button remains a deliberate desktop composition. |
| Data display | 10 | `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Tag`, `Divider`, `Icon`, `List`, `Table`, `ImageList`, `Tooltip`, foundation text/type scale | Strong coverage; typography and icon families are correctly foundation/catalog concerns rather than duplicate leaf components. |
| Feedback | 6 | `Callout`/`Banner`/`StateView`, `Overlay`, `Dialog`, `ProgressBar`/`ProgressCircle`, `Rating`, `Skeleton`, `Toast`/`ToastLayer` | Strong product-neutral coverage, with feedback states retained as caller-owned facts. |
| Surface | 4 | `Accordion`, `DesktopTitlebar`/`Toolbar`, `Card`, theme surface recipes plus `Frost`/`Glass` | Strong coverage by composition and complete surface recipes; no need for a second `Paper` shell. |
| Navigation | 9 | `Tabs`, `Breadcrumb`, `Drawer`, `Menu`, `Pagination`, `Wizard`, `Sidebar` | Strong desktop coverage; Bottom Navigation and Speed Dial are mobile-oriented patterns, not missing desktop primitives. |
| Layout | 5 | `Responsive`, `SplitPane`, `SplitTree`, `AspectRatio`, `Grid`/`Container` | Strong coverage; measured breakpoints preserve source order and caller-owned content. |
| Lab | 2 | `Timeline`, `Masonry` | Strong coverage with caller-measured tile heights and a documented non-virtualized boundary. |
| Utils | 10 | `Popover`, `Overlay`, positioner/focus/portal internals, `TextArea`, motion system, `Responsive` | Foundation coverage is present; these are not all user-facing components and should not inflate the public component count. |
| MUI X | 4 stable families | `DataGrid`, `Calendar`/`DateInput`/`RangePicker`/`TimeInput`, chart family, `Tree`/`TreeGrid` | Strong advanced coverage, with the documented non-virtualized `Table`/`Tree` limitation. |

Several MUI names intentionally resolve to existing primitives instead of new
public types. `Paper` is a surface recipe, `Typography` is the typed text
foundation, `Stack` and `Box` are ordinary GPUI composition, `Radio Group` is
the caller's group of `Radio` controls, and Modal/Popper/Portal/Transitions
are overlay and motion infrastructure. This is not a gap: duplicating them as
thin wrappers would create another style system. Conversely, a component is
not marked covered merely because a similarly named primitive can be composed;
the state, input, semantic, and caller-owned event contracts must also line up.

The MUI- and shadcn-derived component review is complete as of 2026-08-27.
Every component below has a public contract, a scene exhibit, simulated
behaviour coverage, semantic ids, and a documentation entry:

| Completed capability | Implementation boundary |
|---|---|
| Multiple selection / `MultiSelect` | Searchable controlled listbox with stable option identities, removable chips, disabled options, keyboard toggling, and caller-owned selected values. |
| Scalar `Rating` | Controlled whole/half precision rating with pointer and keyboard input, clearable/unrated and disabled states, and accessible value semantics. |
| `TransferList` | Controlled source/target assignment panes with filtering, truthful counts, individual selection, disabled items, move intents, and no component-owned mutation. |
| Horizontal and vertical `Slider` | One orientation-aware contract keeps track geometry, pointer mapping, keyboard direction, marks, range fill, and AccessKit orientation aligned. |
| Declarative `Grid` / `Container` | Token-backed measured breakpoints, columns, spans, gaps, readable widths, and source-order semantics. |
| `ImageList` | Stable selectable media tiles with measured responsive columns and token-backed layout; media phase remains caller-owned. |
| `Masonry` | Stable variable-height tiles placed into the shortest measured column with responsive token-backed columns and gaps. |
| Auto-growing `TextArea` | Bounded autosize measures shaped visual rows, preserves editor state, and scrolls after the maximum row bound. |
| Source `Editor` | One no-wrap `TextArea` projection adds hard-line numbers/geometry, revision-safe caller highlights, and caller-owned indentation without duplicating buffer, caret, IME, history, paint, or hit testing. |
| `Bubble` | Neutral caller-owned message surface with placement, grouping, max width, safe content, and optional actions. |
| `Carousel` | Controlled stable-item track with previous/next/direct selection, keyboard navigation, clipping, reduced motion, and truthful state phases. |

Ordinary `MultiSelect`, `TransferList`, `ImageList`, and `Masonry` instances
are intentionally non-virtualized components. Their option/tile sets are
caller-owned and should be kept to a bounded presentation size; very large
datasets must use `List`, `DataGrid`, or another caller-owned virtualized
surface. This is a documented performance boundary, not an unimplemented
component API.

These are distinct from cross-library or product patterns such as a
confirmation popover, product tour, sticky/affixed content, QR code, or
watermark. They may be useful additions, but they are not MUI Core entries and
must not be reported as MUI coverage gaps. Their priority should be decided by
desktop product demand and by whether GPUI has the required framework primitive,
not by inflating a benchmark score.

Document tabs, `SearchField`, `FindReplace`, `NotificationCenter`, `CodeView`,
and `UploadList` are covered above. `FailurePanel` presents an ordinary
caller-owned failure; a render error boundary is not implementable while GPUI
rendering is infallible and its draw arenas are not unwind-safe.

`Toggle`, `ToggleGroup`, `Collapsible`, `HoverCard`, `Menubar`, `CopyButton`
and `AspectRatio` are covered above. Three of them were built on top of what
was already here rather than beside it, which is the whole reason they are
small: `Collapsible` is an `Accordion` with one section, `Menubar` is a row of
`Menu` views with the row's own three behaviours added, and `Toggle` is a
`Button` that publishes a checked state. Two of them state a limit rather than
inventing an answer, and `crates/docs/components.md` carries both — what `CopyButton`
can and cannot know about the clipboard, and what a hover card's grace period
is for. `Cascader`, `AnchorList`, and `DiagnosticsList` are also covered above;
they compose the existing popover/menu, navigation, list, filter, badge, and
status vocabulary instead of creating parallel application infrastructure.

Mentions in a text field and settings search now share Kit contracts.
`MentionInput` owns trigger detection, querying, stable candidate focus,
caret-anchored presentation, and completion insertion while callers own
candidate retrieval, stable identity, exact replacement text, and the semantic
attachment of accepted identity to plain text. `SettingsList` filters sections
and rows through the installed locale matcher, includes visible row copy and
explicit caller-authored aliases/control vocabulary, preserves the settings
page's familiar order, counts the result, and presents a distinct no-match
state. `UndoHistory` covers the caller-owned revision list and reports restore
intents without keeping or mutating an undo stack. The non-rendering
`reactive::History<T>` is the bounded undo/redo record store beneath callers
that need one: ignored records are refused by the model, a divergent push
clears redo, and the caller remains responsible for applying every record.
`PerformanceHud` covers live diagnostics without turning the observer into the
workload: framework `FrameTimingMonitor` filters and bounds existing per-window
submissions, while the controlled Kit view presents the caller's latest summary
and never schedules another frame. Framework records preserve every draw for
benchmarks, then pair the latest newly drawn scene with platform submission and
its coalesced top-level input. The pairing survives concurrent trace leases and
cannot cross a disable/re-enable boundary. It intentionally stops when the
synchronous platform draw call returns: compositor/display presentation,
upstream journal/hang reporting, and the debug overlay remain outside this
port.

Application forms now cover date, time, range, files, and repeating sections.
Date facts come from `DateAdapter`; file admissibility and display names come
from `SchemaFilePolicy`, while the host still opens the OS picker. Repeating
sections keep stable visual identity and nested values without owning product
data. Host-declared conditional rules resolve into `FieldVisibility`: visible,
or hidden with `Omit` / `Include` submission policy. Hidden fields and subtrees
cannot become invisible validation blockers. `values()` remains the complete
held-value inventory while `submission_values()` applies that explicit policy;
the form never owns the condition or removes caller data.

`LineChart` and `BarChart` now cover the cartesian presentation gap with keyed
motion, area fills, pointer and keyboard crosshairs, exact host-formatted text,
and stale-data retention. Domains, ticks, aggregation, and queries remain host
facts rather than drawing work. `Plot` supplies the lower generic measured
frame and semantic mark traversal. `CandlestickChart` and `SankeyChart` render
caller-normalized OHLC and flow geometry through that boundary; neither owns a
market scale, topology algorithm, value transform, or financial vocabulary.

Agent and game applications now have product-neutral run, persona, party,
objective, ability, and reward families rather than one-off downstream cards.
`ApprovalPrompt`, `PermissionMatrix`, `CostMeter`, and the context gauge keep
approval, scope, and estimated costs explicit. `OfferingCatalog` covers Tool,
Skill, and Resource results together rather than creating separate
`ToolCatalog` and `SkillCard` APIs; per-server attribution is part of every
result because two servers may offer the same name. `LogStream`, `DiffView`,
`JsonView`, `SchemaForm`, `ServerList`, `OfferingCatalog`, and `NodeGraph` are
covered above.

`NodeGraph` remains the lower-level graph whose caller supplies coordinates.
`AgentRunCanvas` is the high-level run composition for a caller that has only
typed topology: `AgentRunLayout` supplies its deterministic layered,
RTL-aware placement. A product-specific force layout or manually persisted
coordinates can still use `NodeGraph` directly without creating a second run
presentation contract downstream.

### Controlled interaction boundaries

Tree and TreeGrid horizontal navigation only selects enabled direct relatives:
entering an expanded branch skips disabled direct children but never selects a
grandchild or a neighboring root; a disabled parent refuses upward selection.
These rules are exercised in both reading directions. Disabled MultiSelect
publishes disabled root and chip semantics and mounts no chip remove buttons.

DockTree accepts a drag only when its exact source tab surface exists in the
caller's topology and the dragged panel belongs to that stack. Dock roots may
be prefix-related; their fully composed semantic surface ids must still be
unique within the window, like other semantic identities.

The window modal stack owns Dialog/Drawer focus restoration, including non-LIFO
close and the return chain after a covered modal closes. Drawer releases modal
ownership at close; its delayed exit removes paint without restoring focus a
second time. Callers must close a modal before removing its entity: arbitrary
unmount cleanup is not yet an implemented lifecycle contract.

NodeGraph reconciles active gestures against current caller-owned nodes and
interaction mode on redraw. Deleted peers are removed without rebasing surviving
drag origins; deleting the active target or revoking its interaction cancels the
gesture. Fit prefers native scale but the configured zoom range prevails over
that preference, and the same legal zoom determines its offset and event.

Kit's shared paint-only pointer-cancel listener uses GPUI's MouseCancelEvent,
not a synthetic release. Custom graph, grid range/resize, split, drawer resize,
text-selection, image/model, transport, scrollbar, and drag-session state is
abandoned without drop, click, or seek completion. Deterministic regressions
dispatch cancellation twice and verify subsequent gestures; they do not claim
physical-device/browser delivery coverage beyond the framework platform lanes.

### Capabilities that are not components

| Gap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Grayscale glyph compositing | Metal now applies the same DirectWrite-derived contrast/gamma alpha correction as Direct3D and WGPU when tinting atlas coverage. Glyphs remain reusable grayscale masks, so destination-aware Core Text / AppKit smoothing is still not available. macOS stays grayscale-only. Linear atlas sampling can still soften 12–13px geometric faces; changing that filter would also affect monochrome SVG icons that share the same sprite path. |
| Complete copies across unmounted text | GPUI now coordinates one grapheme-safe selection across separately mounted `StyledText` participants in caller-declared reading order, with pointer capture, keyboard copy/select-all, AccessKit text runs, and overlay scope isolation. `AgentDocument`, `CodeView`, `Markdown`, `LogStream`, `DiffView`, and `HighlightedText` participate. A selection crossing virtualized rows copies the mounted text and reports that it is incomplete; whole-value component copy actions remain the path to content GPUI never laid out. |
| Text range highlighting | `HighlightedText`, `LogStream`, `CodeView` and `DiffView` render caller-supplied ranges while constructing their text. GPUI still has no API that marks a substring of an arbitrary already-rendered text element, which blocks a generic find-in-page overlay. |
| Writing direction | `LayoutDirection` supplies logical row order, start/end spacing and borders, text alignment, directional glyph mirroring, and reading-order keyboard traversal across controls, navigation, menus, calendars, trees, structured views, and schema forms. Unicode bidi shaping keeps mixed Arabic/Hebrew, Latin, punctuation, and numbers in logical order. Host-owned localized copy, locale formatting, and a larger language-specific bidi corpus remain integration work rather than component geometry. |
| Number, date, and quantity formatting | `NumberAdapter` owns every library-authored numeric shape — grouped counts and decimals, editable parsing, plural category, count-of-total, percent, multiplier, dimensions, ordinals, signed deltas, lower bounds, and affix placement. `Strings` owns every phrase and its zero/one/two/few/many/other variants. Dates remain the parallel `DateAdapter` contract. See "Numbers a catalogue cannot fix alone" below. |
| Assistive technology gaps | Basic semantics, grapheme-based editable and read-only text runs, shared shaped character/caret geometry, selection actions, explicit live-region properties, same-window labelled-by/described-by relationships, and deferred-overlay active descendants now reach GPUI's AccessKit platform tree. macOS and Windows natively verify relationship-derived field name/help and editable character/caret geometry; Windows additionally verifies ValuePattern editing and MenuItem focus/invocation/lifetime. Cross-tree completion focus is deterministic only. Native-child handoff, platform live-event verification, remaining Windows overlay/event sessions, and Linux AT-SPI validation are active foundation work; see `crates/docs/accessibility.md` and `crates/docs/foundation-roadmap.md`. |
| Validation vocabulary | `ValidationState` is the caller-owned `Pending` / `Validating` / `Invalid { reason }` / `Valid` ladder. `FormField` presents it without painting in-flight work as failure; `SchemaForm` keeps field and whole-form validation separate and blocks submission while an explicitly managed check is pending or validating. Rules and timing remain host-owned. |
| Schema field participation | `FieldVisibility` records the result of a host-owned condition without evaluating it. Hidden fields are absent from rendering and field validation; `HiddenSubmission::Omit` removes the subtree only from `submission_values`, while `Include` preserves its complete held subtree. `values` stays lossless, and a hidden object or repeated-list parent governs every descendant. |
| Settings search | `SettingsList` takes the query a host commonly receives from `SearchField` and owns matching, filtering, result counting, and the no-match state for complete `SettingsSection` builders. Label, description, badge, displayed value, management reason, section context, and `SettingsRow::search_terms` all use the installed `SearchMatcher`; text hidden inside an arbitrary caller control must be named explicitly. Matches retain section and row order rather than turning preferences into a ranked command palette. |
| Settings grouping | `SettingsSection` is a headed group of rows on the page plane. It no longer paints a raised card around the rows; heading, spacing, and each row's own padding carry the group. Only the control the typist can operate keeps a bounded surface. |
| Composition | `Slotted` lets a caller replace a node a component authored rather than only configure it. A component publishes only positions its public state model can actually reach as `SLOTS`, and a name outside that list panics rather than silently rendering nothing. Surfaces with loading and failure phases offer those distinct slots; an empty-only collection offers only `empty`. No component yet slots a node that is not a whole-region state. |
| Size response | `Responsive` builds its content from its own measured width, so a component laid out in a sidebar and in a full-width page arranges itself differently without either of them consulting the window. `ContainerSize` reports `Unmeasured` for the one frame before there is a width rather than guessing at one. `Grid` and `Container` now provide the shared token-backed breakpoint vocabulary; `Toolbar` measures its cut from the widths it recorded last frame; `overflow_after` remains for a caller who already knows. The remaining framework boundary is response to a size a component cannot itself be given, such as the width of a sibling. |
| Style escape hatch | `ThemeOverlay` installs a caller-adjusted `Theme` for one subtree and pops it afterwards, in every element phase, so an override cannot reach a sibling. What comes back is a whole `Theme`, so the subtree still reads a complete token set and a component inside it cannot tell it was overridden. There is still no way to override *one property of one instance* without constructing a theme for it, which is deliberate: a per-instance colour is how a library stops being one. |
| Non-virtualized `Table` and `Tree` | `List`, `DataGrid`, and `MessageList` virtualize. These two lay out every row. |

### Numbers a catalogue cannot fix alone

`gpui_kit::strings` closes both halves of localization without making a
component infer either one. `Strings` places facts inside phrases and selects
host-installed `zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, or `other` variants.
`NumberAdapter` shapes the facts themselves: grouped counts and decimals,
editable decimal parsing, count-of-total, percentages, quantities and affixes,
image dimensions, ordered-list markers, signed deltas, lower bounds, and
playback multipliers. `NumberInput` writes and reads through the same adapter,
so a localized value never becomes unparsable merely because the control drew
it. Pagination, search, grids, document views, media, navigation, forms,
canvas, game, and agent surfaces all use that boundary for the numeric facts
they author.

That does not make the library the owner of every number it receives.
Caller-authored labels, clock readouts, currency and cost strings, source text,
terminal output, paths, identifiers, and diagnostics remain verbatim because
re-parsing them would change caller-owned meaning. Numeric geometry used only
for layout, rendering, hit testing, stable ids, and debug output is not reader
copy and is not localized. Date facts remain on the parallel `DateAdapter`;
the host still owns its calendar, locale, and time zone. The built-in English
adapter is a complete fallback, not a claim to discover the host locale.

### Delivery

`CHANGELOG.md` and the versioning policy in `README.md` now say what a consumer
pins and what breaks them, including the two breaks the compiler cannot see: a
token key and a semantic id. The publishable crates are a crates.io cohort;
GPUI Box is no longer a git dependency of itself. An enforceable structural
and calibrated timing budget is active foundation work in
`crates/docs/foundation-roadmap.md`; until that phase lands, virtualization behavior
tests still do not fail on every class of slowdown.
The hosted catalog at gpui-box.origingame.dev is the published documentation;
it is deployed from a checkout and is not itself a crates.io release.

The visual regression gate is `headless check`. It renders offscreen at a
fixed device-pixel size, so it does not depend on a composited, frontmost
window or the host display. Linux (llvmpipe) is compared at every commit by
`gate full` on the orb; macOS (Metal) and Windows (WARP) are compared when the
dispatch-only `Platforms` workflow runs, which is on demand rather than on
push. `crates/docs/screenshot-testing.md` describes the gate and review workflow.

## Rules every covered component follows

1. The answer belongs to the caller. A component holds hover, focus, open, and
   animation state; a value, a selection, a sort, and an expansion belong to
   the host, which is why every one of them reports an intent instead of
   applying it. Where a component needs a fact it cannot hold either — what
   day it is, what a month is called, whether a range's days can be listed —
   it takes an injected reader for that fact rather than deriving one, and a
   reader that answers "I don't know" is answering.
2. A refused or disabled control installs no handler at all.
3. Loading, empty, unstarted, unavailable, and failed are distinct, and a
   refusal is never rendered as an absence of data. A question nobody could
   answer is distinct again: a calendar with no month to show renders
   unavailable rather than blank, and a range whose days could not be
   enumerated reports unchecked rather than clear.
4. Ids come from business identity, never from list position.
5. Anything visible comes from tokens. Wording that belongs to the host — a
   refusal's reason, a month's name, a message saying why text could not be
   read — is shown verbatim and never authored by a component. Wording the
   library does author comes from `gpui_kit::strings`, so a host replaces it
   without forking the component; `cargo run -p xtask -- strings check` fails
   the build if a component grows a literal a reader could read.
6. A component that can carry a credential publishes its shape, never its text.

## Headless capture order dependence — glass probes

Metal review on 2026-09-08 found a reproducible difference between the complete
catalog and the selected sequence `actions cascader context-menu dialog drawer
form glass mention-input menu menubar multi-select notification-center overlay
toast` (executed in catalog order). In the `glass` budget capsules/shadows,
dark has 80 pixels differing by more than one channel step (maximum 2), and
light has 1,623 (maximum 4). Repeated complete runs agree byte-for-byte;
`headless check glass` alone also agrees with the complete run. Full-catalog
captures remain authoritative; the one-step comparison tolerance is unchanged.

Temporary input traces ruled out surface/lobe admission drift: all 16 admitted
surfaces have identical bounds, lobe counts and ordering in both runs, and only
budget capsules A–G are admitted. H/I are opaque fallbacks in both. The difference
is their probe ownership: complete/standalone runs assign H/I slots 14/15 with
`None`, while the selected sequence reuses slots 3/4 and reads the previous
scene's `Some(0.92572516)` in both themes. That value changes `glass_shadows`.

The former Kit `ProbeLease::slot`/`Drop` allocated/released slot numbers
without invalidating renderer samples. Keyed state has a two-frame retention
grace. Metal `read_probe_values` overwrites only requested slots, so an
unadmitted replacement surface never refreshes its inherited value. The shared
headless window/renderer and two-identical-frame settling test cannot detect a
stable stale sample. This is a located product probe-lifetime defect, not merely
atlas rounding: opening and closing overlays can give a replacement fallback
surface another surface's shadow strength.

The product fix moves ownership to framework `LuminanceProbeLease` and
`LuminanceProbeCache`. The existing u32 material probe is an opaque ID with
4 physical-slot bits and 28 generation bits. Reacquisition changes generation;
exhausted slots retire permanently instead of wrapping or issuing the all-ones
sentinel. Renderers decode only GPU offsets, retaining full IDs for cached values.
Each submitted frame registers its actually encoded probes, including an empty
set: fallback/unsubmitted surfaces read `None`. Callbacks carry the submission
sequence and full ID, rejecting old owners, previous activations and out-of-order
older samples. Continuously active owners keep their latest completed reading;
Metal adds no GPU wait. All three backends use this shared CPU cache without
changing shader or GPU buffer layouts. No renderer-per-scene reset or tolerance
increase is used. Portable tests cover reuse, fallback, late callbacks and
generation exhaustion; a Metal test covers actual GPU submission and slot reuse.

Metal verification: the 14-scene run and complete catalog both pass the existing
one-step gate, and the complete catalog is 312/312 without replacement baselines.
The original H/I shadow differences are gone. Whole `glass` frames are **not**
byte-identical: the separate image-atlas rounding below remains.

The strict cross-platform reproduction uses the native Metal renderer on macOS
and real software WGPU adapter on Linux/Windows, with no baseline writes:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path tools/headless-visual/Cargo.toml -- check-order glass \
  actions cascader context-menu dialog drawer form mention-input menu menubar \
  multi-select notification-center overlay toast
cargo test -p gpui-box-wgpu a_reacquired_probe_requires_its_own_admitted_wgpu_submission -- --nocapture
```

`check-order` compares raw RGBA bytes, reports exact equality, differing-pixel
counts, maximum channel step and inclusive bounds as JSON, and saves both target
frames under `target/headless-order-check/{full,scoped}` and an amplified difference
map under `diff-x64`. It fails even on the
known one-step atlas difference: it is a diagnostic, not the tolerant catalog
gate. The WGPU lease regression requires an adapter on Linux/Windows rather than
silently skipping there; only a Metal host may skip the software WGPU execution.

## Image-atlas placement precision — separate from probe ownership

After the lease fix, selected/full `glass` frames differ at 80 dark pixels and
84 light pixels, all by **one** channel step (none above one). Dark bounds are
(1179,504)–(1430,534), light (1158,504)–(1474,538), in the Regular-on-media
card's top rim/shadow, not budget capsules H/I. The comparison tolerance is not
increased and these frames are not described as byte-identical.

Captured CPU inputs rule out probe ownership: both runs publish the same
Regular-media luminance sequence, ending at `0.49284562` in dark and `0.5068491`
in light. Sprite bounds are identically `(816,448)+(768×288)` device pixels.
The identical 384×144 image occupies polychrome texture 0 at tile `(48,0)`
(TileId 4096) in the selected run, versus `(48,368)` (TileId 4100) in the full
run, with zero padding in both. Metal's polychrome vertex shader adds this
atlas origin before normalized-UV interpolation; its fragment linearly samples
those UVs. This is placement-dependent image sampling precision, not a leftover
lease value. It is visible at the material/shadow compositing rounding boundary.

Atlas placement is already integral. Removing the half-texel source-rectangle
inset would break texel-centre semantics, not correct this precision contract.
A future fix needs tile-local interpolation and translation-invariant sampling,
with source rectangles, transformed sprites, edge filtering and all three
shader backends verified. It potentially changes every image/textured-sprite
baseline on Metal, Linux WGPU and Windows; it is not hidden in probe lifetime
or addressed by a headless-only atlas reset.

## Clear Pill geometry and dimming order

A 200×41 Clear Pill above an image reproduced the downstream failure on Metal:
raw and interior pixels were both `[100,80,60]`. Kit passed the Pill token's
999 radius directly to raw quad/backdrop paint, while the styled child fitted
it to half the shortest side (20.5). The oversized SDF discarded both dimming
and optics. BackdropLayer and collected GlassPane lobes now use the framework's
existing `clamp_radii_for_quad_size`, matching their styled surfaces without
changing raw framework paint semantics.

Fitting the radius exposed a separate ordering dependency: the same-layer
black quad attenuated the completed optics, producing `[80,66,53]`. Clear
dimming now multiplies transmission gain by `1 - effect.glassDimming` inside
the material, before wash/lift/highlights. No extra quad, shader ABI change or
product workaround is needed. The pixel regression renders a clipped rounded
card, Cover image, absolute Pill and ghost Xs button with the platform's native
headless renderer. It checks the independent equation
`raw × 0.65 × 1.042 + 255 × 0.075`, yielding `[87,73,60]`, the retained rim,
and untouched pixels outside the rounded arc. Flat elevation isolates material
math from shadows. Run it on Metal or Linux/WGPU with:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path tools/headless-visual/Cargo.toml \
  clear_pill_dims_media_inside_a_clipped_card -- --nocapture
```

## Unicode line breaks across text and inline objects

Both `LineWrapper::wrap_line` and shaped `LineLayout` use the Unicode 15.0
UAX #14 opportunities from the existing `unicode-linebreak` 0.1.5 package.
Wrapped truncation obtains its line starts and continuation indentation from
`wrap_line`, rather than keeping another word-character table. Single-line
ellipsis fitting still measures characters; it does not choose word breaks.

Text fragments are concatenated only for classification, with each inline
element represented by U+FFFC. The width walk keeps separate normalized-text
and original byte offsets, so an element's arbitrary `len_utf8` never shifts
the returned caller indices. Shaped glyph runs query the same Unicode rules
at their logical byte indices; a font/run boundary is not a break opportunity.
Tests force overflowing closing punctuation and opening brackets, cross text
and element boundaries, preserve Latin words and nonbreaking glue, exercise
CJK/Latin mixing, and check mandatory breaks and ellipsis run lengths.

Emergency character/item wrapping remains the fallback when no legal break
fits: extremely narrow widths can still split an otherwise unbreakable unit.
This is not punctuation hanging, width expansion, dictionary-based breaking
for complex scripts, or a locale-tailored Japanese typography engine. The
`markdown` exhibit includes a narrow mixed Chinese/Latin paragraph, rendered
with the bundled Noto Sans SC fallback, to review punctuation and word wrapping
in both themes without depending on system fonts.

## Intrinsic image sizing is separate from object fitting

The apparent missing image corner mask was a layout error shared by Metal and
WGPU: a 480×144 image in an 880×220 `size_full` card acquired an 880×264
layout box. Its lower rounded corners fell below the parent's rectangular
clip. The atlas upload and shader coverage retained the correct radii.

`Window::request_intrinsic_layout` supplies natural dimensions separately
from authored styles. An Intrinsic node is a replaced leaf: its content has
a natural size independent of text flow, currently an already-loaded `Img`.
Loading/error image replacements remain ordinary elements; text and other
arbitrary measure callbacks remain stock measured leaves. The GPUI layout
view uses Taffy's existing container
algorithms and cache, but resolves intrinsic leaves before the stock leaf's
aspect-ratio height floor can overwrite a determined axis. Ordinary measured
text still uses the stock leaf. There is one active result map, retained with
the tree cache and cleared with it; no stock high-level layout call runs in
parallel with this view. No renderer format or dependency authority changes.

The sizing matrix exercises block, row/column flex, grid, absolute insets,
resolved and unresolved percentages, explicit aspect ratio, natural sizes,
padding and size constraints. A pure measure callback was insufficient in
block final layout: width 240 with auto height became 240×144 instead of
240×72. Injecting the natural ratio only for one auto axis fixed that case,
but width 240 with max-height 36 became 120×36. Both are regression targets,
not accepted approximations. A zero-size asset has no natural ratio.

The cross-platform headless pixel regression uses 480×220 and 880×220 Cover
cards with rounded images and a bottom Clear caption. It checks all four
corners against the outside ground, and passes on both Metal and Linux WGPU
real adapters. Kit adds no mask or component-specific sizing workaround.
`cinematic-effects` additionally reviews
Contain: a 240×140 frame in a 372×154 slot remains centered at 264×154 rather
than forcing the slot to the image's intrinsic ratio.

## Incremental source-text foundation

The shared EditBuffer uses persistent storage and indexed LF lines/UTF-16
conversion. Grapheme clamping borrows rope chunks, including unbounded
combining and regional-indicator context. Tests exercise 200,000 source lines
and a four-million-byte single line without materializing a compatibility
string on edits. Legacy `text()` still explicitly materializes a whole value.

No-wrap TextArea and Editor shape visible rows, with exact offscreen geometry
shaped on demand. Whole-document selection paints only visible rows, and
accessibility cell geometry captures only paintable bytes. Shaping budgets
measure actual input bytes and lines (`EditableTextWork`), not allocation
counts. Dense and lazy Unicode/bidi geometry are compared directly.

TextArea `Change` and Editor `Changed` carry persistent `EditSnapshot` values;
subscribers opt into contiguous whole-document text with `snapshot.text()`.
The internal Editor subscription preserves the snapshot rather than forcing
legacy string materialization. This is an API migration for consumers that
previously accepted strings. `painted_lines()` returns owned shared lines;
new event variants and work-counter fields also require consumers with
exhaustive matches or struct literals to migrate.

Soft-wrap retains exact paragraph shapes across revisions and viewport changes.
Cold layout and font/width reflow shape all paragraphs; a local edit reshapes
the changed paragraph, but rebuilds document-wide wrapped and row indexes.
Warm scrolling reuses both shapes and indexes. Accessibility receives rows
from that same prepaint, avoiding a hard-row to wrapped-row topology reset
after an edit. Folded layouts retain full-source accessibility rows, including
hidden text. Mounted tests distinguish first-edit publication from the next
settled draw rather than hiding rebuild work behind a warm frame.

Static native parents retain complete Value, and identical visible TextRuns
are reused. Row arrays and grapheme representability are revision-keyed.
These caches do not bound total frame or edit work: stock native tree metadata,
changed selection/value publication, explicit full-value queries, and source
snapshot materialization still have document-sized costs. A very long visible
hard line or wrapped paragraph is shaped whole. No native Value/AXValue is
omitted to meet a budget, and no local AccessKit fork is assumed.

Multicursor/rectangle edits, source folding, and caller-owned language services
have their own behavior tests and exhibits; their presence does not establish
a viewport-bounded large-file editor. Shaping, parser, row-index and publication
counters report their named work only, not total allocations or native backend
costs. Linux headless evidence does not replace the native platform lanes.

## Native browser engines remain independent of Kit

`gpui-box-webview` supplies caller-owned Wry engine hosts: WKWebView, WebView2,
and WebKitGTK on X11/XWayland. It renders full browser HTML/CSS, independently
of native Markdown/HTML text rendering. BrowserPanel remains a caller-owned
shell; no browser transport enters Kit. The native example and executable
smoke live in `crates/gpui-webview/examples`; see [the host contract](webview.md).

The Linux framework now attaches real X11 children, crops native pixels and
input through a separate rectangular parent, allocates the full toolkit
viewport, and restores the child on detach. X11 native tests cover geometry,
DPI, pointer hit testing, stacking and ownership. Native Wayland embedding,
X11 GPUI scene overlays above native children, arbitrary subtree transforms,
rounded native masks and alpha compositing are deferred framework gaps, not
emulated browser support. macOS/Windows native focus, IME, accessibility and
overlay behavior still need platform-run evidence. Origin-aware asynchronous
permission approvals are not represented by Wry's kind-only callback; current
host policy refuses surfaced permission, popup and download requests.

## Native editable geometry preserves affinity, not missing font data

`EditableTextLayout` exposes selection fragments, cluster-edge carets, visual
navigation and Unicode paragraph base-direction queries over the retained
`WrappedLine` glyph cells and soft-wrap indices. `NativeTextPosition` retains
both incident edges at bidi and wrap boundaries; `NativeTextSelection` stores
the primary anchor/head affinities atomically in `EditBuffer` and its history.
Legacy logical selection setters reset both affinities to downstream. Secondary
cursors remain logical-only; native primary selection clears them. Active IME
cancellation restores the original selection and text, including in secret
fields, without enabling completed secret undo/redo history.

The asymmetric geometry tests supply explicit shaped glyph positions and
exercise mixed bidi travel in both directions, wrap affinity, actual row heights,
graphemes, UTF-16 surrogate rejection, reversed selections and history. They
prove platform-independent geometry/model behavior, not UIKit or Android
execution. Native adapters and the macOS/Windows lanes need their own evidence.
No renderer or component painting changes are implied by these additive APIs.

`ShapedGlyph` has no font-provided ligature caret table or per-grapheme advances
inside a multi-grapheme shaping cluster. An interior caret query, or horizontal
movement requiring that caret, returns `None`; selection covers the complete
painted cluster. Supplying GDEF/platform caret data at the shaping boundary is
the prerequisite to lifting that limitation; interpolating a width is not a
substitute. The current layout paints uniform-height horizontal rows. Paragraph
direction overrides are not in the editable model, so mutation stays explicitly
unsupported. Native caret bounds resolve only the incident hard paragraph,
using indexed UTF-16 conversion for source-backed layouts; painting a visible
caret preserves the viewport shaping budget. Point, selection-fragment,
farthest-position and movement queries still enumerate the document and may
shape offscreen lazy lines; those are not viewport-bounded operations.
