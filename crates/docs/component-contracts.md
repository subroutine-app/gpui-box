# Component contracts

## General contract

Every component:

1. consumes `gpui_kit_theme::Theme`;
2. accepts display data from the caller;
3. emits an application-owned callback;
4. owns only visual transient state;
5. remains independent of host services and product models;
6. exposes a stable semantic target when it is actionable or assertable.

In-content fields, bordered buttons and selection knobs share an opaque
control fill, a quiet definition hairline and a top inset highlight. They do
not use Liquid Glass. Hover and pressed fills belong to the same material;
focus and invalidity are halos without layout changes. Selection is tonal,
and rule/divider lines do not carry a 3:1 contrast requirement. Grouped
settings contain aligned rows and inset rules rather than unrelated wells.

## Buttons

`Button` supports Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Danger, and Link variants across
the four steps of the control scale. When disabled or loading it does not
register the click listener at all.

Primary is reserved for the main action in a local decision area. Danger is
only for destructive or irreversible intent.

## Badge and status

Badges are compact labels. Status dots and callouts carry semantic state.
Neutral is the default; Accent, Success, Warning, Danger, and Info must match
the actual state.

Do not use Success to make an idle state look healthy.

## Cards and settings

`Card` groups related rows. `ListRow` supplies spacing, separators, and the
quiet hover wash. Identity tiles are optional. Row content must preserve the
title when detail text is long.

Settings pages use:

- a centered 768px maximum column;
- 24px horizontal inset;
- 32px top rhythm;
- title, subtitle, section title, card, and optional footnote.

Product-specific settings models stay in the application.

## Popovers and dialogs

Floating layers:

- are deferred above normal content;
- occlude hit testing beneath them;
- snap to the viewport with margin;
- use one frost layer around the complete subtree;
- choose above or below anchoring based on trigger location;
- restore focus and close on Escape in the owning view.

The library supplies geometry and reducers. The owning view supplies open
state, focus handles, keyboard dispatch, dismissal, and actions.

## Loading

Skeleton and spinner slots have fixed layout dimensions. Repeating animation
changes opacity or paint-local size rather than reflowing siblings.

Use:

- skeletons when the eventual content has known row geometry;
- pulse loader for a neutral wait;
- gradient spinner for compact active work;
- spinner for an inline wait next to a label;
- refresh veil when a verified value must stay on screen.

## Long content

External paths, messages, command descriptions, and user content require an
explicit boundary:

- truncate for identity lines;
- wrap for explanatory copy;
- scroll for large output;
- never allow long content to move the primary action outside the viewport.
