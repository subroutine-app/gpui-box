# GPUI Box

GPUI Box is an independent crates.io distribution of the GPUI framework
and a product-neutral component system for native and browser-hosted Rust
interfaces. The project lives at <https://github.com/fran0220/gpui-box>.
It is derived from GPUI source imported from Zed, but it is **not an official
Zed project** and Zed is not a Cargo dependency.

The umbrella workspace provides one framework, one token authority, truthful
async states, caller-owned data and actions, stable semantic automation, and
deterministic scene fixtures. It contains no OriginGame/Forge domain logic,
credentials, transports, accounts, or product models.

**Catalog endpoint:** <https://gpui-box.origingame.dev> ·
**Remote Developer MCP:** <https://gpui-box.origingame.dev/mcp> ·
**Checkout MCP:** `tools/mcp/run.sh`

## Packages

All publishable packages are versioned as the `0.2.x` cohort. Cargo package
names and Rust crate names intentionally differ:

| Cargo package(s) | Rust import | Purpose | License |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gpui-box` | `gpui` | Core framework and the authoritative GPUI type universe | Apache-2.0 |
| `gpui-box-platform` | `gpui_platform` | Platform application construction | Apache-2.0 |
| `gpui-box-macos`, `gpui-box-linux`, `gpui-box-windows`, `gpui-box-web` | platform-specific | Platform implementations | Apache-2.0 |
| `gpui-box-wgpu` | `gpui_wgpu` | WGPU renderer and offscreen support | Apache-2.0 |
| `gpui-box-collections`, `-http-client`, `-macros`, `-media`, `-refineable`, `-refineable-derive`, `-scheduler`, `-shared-string`, `-sum-tree`, `-util`, `-util-macros` | manifest-defined | Framework support crates | Apache-2.0 |
| `gpui-box-kit` | `gpui_kit` | Components, scenes, motion, strings, themes, and truthful state | MIT |
| `gpui-box-kit-tokens`, `-theme`, `-assets`, `-semantics`, `-testkit` | `gpui_kit_*` | Kit package family | MIT (bundled assets retain their licenses) |
| `gpui-box-mcp` | binary | Stateless remote and checkout-backed Developer MCP | MIT |

Gallery, browser-gallery, headless, perf, and `xtask` packages are workspace
tools and are not published. `package-authority.toml` is the exact authority
for package identity and publishability.

## Depend on GPUI Box

Version **0.2.0 is a GitHub source release, not a crates.io publication**.
Use the immutable `v0.2.0` tag below, or replace every `tag` with the same
full `rev` from the GitHub release. Commit the application's `Cargo.lock`
and build with `--locked`; do not track a branch. Cargo aliases retain the
conventional `gpui` and `gpui_kit` imports:

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui = { package = "gpui-box", git = "https://github.com/fran0220/gpui-box", tag = "v0.2.0" }
gpui_platform = { package = "gpui-box-platform", git = "https://github.com/fran0220/gpui-box", tag = "v0.2.0" }
gpui_kit = { package = "gpui-box-kit", git = "https://github.com/fran0220/gpui-box", tag = "v0.2.0" }

[dev-dependencies]
gpui_kit_testkit = { package = "gpui-box-kit-testkit", git = "https://github.com/fran0220/gpui-box", tag = "v0.2.0", features = ["test-support"] }

[patch.crates-io]
block = { git = "https://github.com/fran0220/gpui-box", tag = "v0.2.0" }
```

Keep the `block` patch in the application's workspace root. Cargo does not
inherit dependency workspaces' patches; this is the receipted compatibility
fix for upstream `block` 0.1.6, not a second GPUI implementation. The last
crates.io cohort remains `0.1.1`; it does not contain the 0.2.0 changes.

Do not add another GPUI implementation to the same application. Every
framework and kit crate in this cohort resolves through `gpui-box`, producing a
single package/type/global universe. Consumers neither pin Zed nor add a Zed
Git dependency.

The core defaults enable `font-kit`, Wayland, X11, and Windows manifest support;
turn defaults off and select `wayland`, `x11`, `windows-manifest`,
`screen-capture`, `inspector`, or other core features when a host needs a
narrower build. `gpui-box-kit`'s `fixtures` feature is only the deterministic
calendar used by scenes and tests; keep it off in products. Its optional
`dotlottie` feature adds the bounded pure-Rust `.lottie` raster adapter.
Semantic cinematic recipes, typed playback requests, deterministic posters,
and particle fallbacks remain available without that feature.

Requires Rust 1.97 and edition 2024.

## Boot and component model

```rust
use gpui_kit::prelude::*;

let app = gpui_platform::application().with_assets(gpui_kit::assets::Assets);
app.run(|cx| gpui_kit::install(cx));
```

Install the asset source while constructing the application, then call
`gpui_kit::install` before opening a window. Components hold only transient
visual state. Values, selections, persistence, transports, and refusals belong
to the caller; disabled controls install no action handler. See
[`crates/docs/host-view-boundary.md`](crates/docs/host-view-boundary.md) and
[`crates/docs/truthful-ui.md`](crates/docs/truthful-ui.md).

Tokens in `crates/gpui-kit-tokens/tokens/*.json` are authoritative. The kit
re-exports its common assets, theme, token, and semantics APIs. Public Rust API,
token keys, and stable semantic ids are all compatibility surfaces.

## Gallery and validation

```bash
cargo run -p gpui-box-gallery
cargo run -p xtask -- scenes render
cargo run -p xtask -- gate              # complete non-visual proof, incl. wasm32 check
cargo run -p xtask -- gate full         # gate + rustdoc + this renderer's visual catalog
cargo run -p xtask -- headless check
cargo run -p xtask -- web check
cargo run -p xtask -- web build
cargo run -p xtask -- web smoke
cargo run -p xtask -- web visual check button input dialog node-graph
cargo run -p xtask -- web gate button input dialog node-graph
cargo run -p xtask -- site check
cargo run -p xtask -- site generate
cargo run -p xtask -- package plan
cargo run -p xtask -- package check
```

`scenes render` writes real-window review images; it is not a baseline gate.
Run `gate full` instead of, not after, `gate` when a change can affect rendered
output. The standalone web commands remain useful while iterating; `web gate`
builds and prepares Chromium once before checking the gallery, static-site
embeds, full compose route, and scoped visual proof. `site generate` bundles
that browser build with the static catalog rather than replacing searchable
documentation with a canvas.
Headless baselines cover Linux, macOS, and Windows. `gate full` on Linux is
the gate every commit runs; it compiles every feature natively and for wasm32
and compares the llvmpipe catalog. macOS and Windows native tests and
headless catalogs run on demand through the dispatch-only `Platforms`
workflow. `web smoke` drives a real Chromium session when the browser gallery
changes. Browser validation is single-threaded and does not claim
screen-reader announcements. Exact support and limitations are in
[`crates/docs/compatibility.md`](crates/docs/compatibility.md).

`cargo run -p xtask -- performance check` enforces deterministic structural
budgets for the 10,000-item virtualized surfaces and writes a machine-readable
report. See [`crates/docs/performance-testing.md`](crates/docs/performance-testing.md).

## Imported framework and independence

Framework source was filtered into this repository from
`fran0220/zed@0b9c8dc932b65cba2dc87464148984e93f60ae18`, against official Zed
baseline `a6a23c7b80a5cefa0487b7856335be89ace7e483`. That import is frozen:
GPUI Box now develops its framework, platforms, media, and Kit directly in this
repository. `scripts/sync-zed` only verifies the offline historical receipt;
Zed is neither a linked package nor an ongoing development source. See
[`PROVENANCE.md`](PROVENANCE.md).

## License

The framework cohort is Apache-2.0. GPUI Box Kit and MCP are MIT. Bundled Geist
and Noto fonts are OFL 1.1; Phosphor Icons are MIT; other derived assets
retain their stated terms. See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES).

The former <https://gpui-kit.origingame.dev> endpoint remains a compatibility
alias backed by the same immutable BWG release; it is not a second deployment.
Deployment details are in [`crates/docs/deploying.md`](crates/docs/deploying.md), and release
operations are in [`crates/docs/releasing.md`](crates/docs/releasing.md).
